Updater's note:

The headers of the vfair10.* and vfair11.* filesets contain 
an incorrect etext number--#577.

The vfair12*.* fileset contains the correct etext number--#599.

Since all the files are for the same book (Thackeray's "Vanity
Fair"), they have been collected into the same folder.
