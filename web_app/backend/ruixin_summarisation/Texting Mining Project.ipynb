       "'1. DOING THE RIGHT THING\\nIn the summer of 2004,\\n Hurricane Charley roared out of the Gulf of Mexico and swept across Florida\\nto the Atlantic Ocean. The storm claimed twenty-two lives and caused $11 billion in damage.\\n1\\n It also left\\nin its wake a debate about price gouging.\\nAt a gas station in Orlando, they were selling two-dollar bags of ice for ten dollars. Lacking power for\\nrefrigerators or air-conditioning in the middle of August, many people had little choice but to pay up.\\nDowned trees heightened demand for chain saws and roof repairs. Contractors offered to clear two\\ntrees off a homeowner’s roof—for $23,000. Stores that normally sold small household generators for\\n$250 were now asking $2,000. A seventy-seven-year-old woman fleeing the hurricane with her elderly\\nhusband and handicapped daughter was charged $160 per night for a motel room that normally goes for\\n$40.\\n2\\nMany Floridians were angered by the inflated prices. “After Storm Come the Vultures,” read a headline\\nin \\nUSA Today\\n. One resident, told it would cost $10,500 to remove a fallen tree from his roof, said it was\\nwrong for people to “try to capitalize on other people’s hardship and misery.” Charlie Crist, the state’s\\nattorney general, agreed: “It is astounding to me, the level of greed that someone must have in their soul\\nto be willing to take advantage of someone suffering in the wake of a hurricane.”\\n3\\nFlorida has a law against price gouging, and in the aftermath of the hurricane, the attorney general’s\\noffice received more than two thousand complaints. Some led to successful lawsuits. A Days Inn in\\nWest Palm Beach had to pay $70,000 in penalties and restitution for overcharging customers.\\n4\\nBut even as Crist set about enforcing the price-gouging law, some economists argued that the law—\\nand the public outrage—were misconceived. In medieval times, philosophers and theologians believed\\nthat the exchange of goods should be governed by a “just price,” determined by tradition or the intrinsic\\nvalue of things. But in market societies, the economists observed, prices are set by supply and demand.\\nThere is no such thing as a “just price.”\\nThomas Sowell, a free-market economist, called price gouging an “emotionally powerful but\\neconomically meaningless expression that most economists pay no attention to, because it seems too\\nconfused to bother with.” Writing in the \\nTampa Tribune\\n, Sowell sought to explain “how ‘price gouging’\\nhelps Floridians.” Charges of price gouging arise “when prices are significantly higher than what people\\nhave been used to,” Sowell wrote. But “the price levels that you happen to be used to” are not morally\\nsacrosanct. They are no more “special or ‘fair’ than other prices” that market conditions—including\\nthose prompted by a hurricane—may bring about.\\n5\\nHigher prices for ice, bottled water, roof repairs, generators, and motel rooms have the advantage,\\nSowell argued, of limiting the use of such things by consumers and increasing incentives for suppliers in\\nfar-off places to provide the goods and services most needed in the hurricane’s aftermath. If ice fetches\\nten dollars a bag when Floridians are facing power outages in the August heat, ice manufacturers will\\nfind it worth their while to produce and ship more of it. There is nothing unjust about these prices, Sowell\\nexplained; they simply reflect the value that buyers and sellers choose to place on the things they\\nexchange.\\n6\\nJeff Jacoby, a pro-market commentator writing in the \\nBoston Globe\\n, argued against price-gouging\\nlaws on similar grounds: “It isn’t gouging to charge what the market will bear. It isn’t greedy or brazen.\\nIt’s how goods and services get allocated in a free society.” Jacoby acknowledged that the “price\\nspikes are infuriating, especially to someone whose life has just been thrown into turmoil by a deadly\\nstorm.” But public anger is no justification for interfering with the free market. By providing incentives for\\nsuppliers to produce more of the needed goods, the seemingly exorbitant prices “do far more good than\\nharm.” His conclusion: “Demonizing vendors won’t speed Florida’s recovery. Letting them go about their\\nbusiness will.”\\n7\\nAttorney General Crist (a Republican who would later be elected governor of Florida) published an op-\\ned piece in the Tampa paper defending the law against price gouging: “In times of emergency,\\ngovernment cannot remain on the sidelines while people are charged unconscionable prices as they fleefor their lives or seek the basic commodities for their families after a hurricane.”\\n8\\n Crist rejected the\\nnotion that these “unconscionable” prices reflected a truly free exchange:\\nThis is not the normal free market situation where willing buyers freely elect to enter into the\\nmarketplace and meet willing sellers, where a price is agreed upon based on supply and\\ndemand. In an emergency, buyers under duress have no freedom. Their purchases of\\nnecessities like safe lodging are forced.\\n9\\nThe debate about price gouging that arose in the aftermath of Hurricane Charley raises hard\\nquestions of morality and law: Is it wrong for sellers of goods and services to take advantage of a\\nnatural disaster by charging whatever the market will bear? If so, what, if anything, should the law do\\nabout it? Should the state prohibit price gouging, even if doing so interferes with the freedom of buyers\\nand sellers to make whatever deals they choose?\\nWelfare, Freedom, and Virtue\\nThese questions are not only about how individuals should treat one another. They are also about what\\nthe law should be, and about how society should be organized. They are questions about justice. To\\nanswer them, we have to explore the meaning of justice. In fact, we’ve already begun to do so. If you\\nlook closely at the price-gouging debate, you’ll notice that the arguments for and against price-gouging\\nlaws revolve around three ideas: maximizing welfare, respecting freedom, and promoting virtue. Each of\\nthese ideas points to a different way of thinking about justice.\\nThe standard case for unfettered markets rests on two claims—one about welfare, the other about\\nfreedom. First, markets promote the welfare of society as a whole by providing incentives for people to\\nwork hard supplying the goods that other people want. (In common parlance, we often equate welfare\\nwith economic prosperity, though welfare is a broader concept that can include noneconomic aspects of\\nsocial well-being.) Second, markets respect individual freedom; rather than impose a certain value on\\ngoods and services, markets let people choose for themselves what value to place on the things they\\nexchange.\\nNot surprisingly, the opponents of price-gouging laws invoke these two familiar arguments for free\\nmarkets. How do defenders of price gouging laws respond? First, they argue that the welfare of society\\nas whole is not really served by the exorbitant prices charged in hard times. Even if high prices call forth\\na greater supply of goods, this benefit has to be weighed against the burden such prices impose on\\nthose least able to afford them. For the affluent, paying inflated prices for a gallon of gas or a motel\\nroom in a storm may be an annoyance; but for those of modest means, such prices pose a genuine\\nhardship, one that might lead them to stay in harm’s way rather than flee to safety. Proponents of price-\\ngouging laws argue that any estimate of the general welfare must include the pain and suffering of those\\nwho may be priced out of basic necessities during an emergency.\\nSecond, defenders of price-gouging laws maintain that, under certain conditions, the free market is\\nnot truly free. As Crist points out, “buyers under duress have no freedom. Their purchases of\\nnecessities like safe lodging are forced.” If you’re fleeing a hurricane with your family, the exorbitant\\nprice you pay for gas or shelter is not really a voluntary exchange. It’s something closer to extortion. So\\nto decide whether price-gouging laws are justified, we need to assess these competing accounts of\\nwelfare and of freedom.\\nBut we also need to consider one further argument. Much public support for price-gouging laws comes\\nfrom something more visceral than welfare or freedom. People are outraged at “vultures” who prey on\\nthe desperation of others and want them punished—not rewarded with windfall profits. Such sentiments\\nare often dismissed as atavistic emotions that should not interfere with public policy or law. As Jacoby\\nwrites, “demonizing vendors won’t speed Florida’s recovery.”\\n10\\nBut the outrage at price-gougers is more than mindless anger. It gestures at a moral argument worth\\ntaking seriously. Outrage is the special kind of anger you feel when you believe that people are getting\\nthings they don’t deserve. Outrage of this kind is anger at injustice.\\nCrist touched on the moral source of the outrage when he described the “greed that someone musthave in their soul to be willing to take advantage of someone suffering in the wake of a hurricane.” He\\ndid not explicitly connect this observation to price-gouging laws. But implicit in his comment is something\\nlike the following argument, which might be called the virtue argument:\\nGreed is a vice, a bad way of being, especially when it makes people oblivious to the suffering of\\nothers. More than a personal vice, it is at odds with civic virtue. In times of trouble, a good society pulls\\ntogether. Rather than press for maximum advantage, people look out for one another. A society in which\\npeople exploit their neighbors for financial gain in times of crisis is not a good society. Excessive greed\\nis therefore a vice that a good society should discourage if it can. Price-gouging \\nlaws cannot banish\\ngreed, but they can at least restrain its most brazen expression, and signal society’s disapproval of it.\\nBy punishing greedy behavior rather than rewarding it, society affirms the civic virtue of shared sacrifice\\nfor the common good.\\nTo acknowledge the moral force of the virtue argument is not to insist that it must always prevail over\\ncompeting considerations. You might conclude, in some instances, that a hurricane-stricken community\\nshould make a devil’s bargain—allow price gouging in hopes of attracting an army of roofers and\\ncontractors from far and wide, even at the moral cost of sanctioning greed. Repair the roofs now and\\nthe social fabric later. What’s important to notice, however, is that the debate about price-gouging laws\\nis not simply about welfare and freedom. It is also about virtue—about cultivating the attitudes and\\ndispositions, the qualities of character, on which a good society depends.\\nSome people, including many who support price-gouging laws, find the virtue argument discomfiting.\\nThe reason: It seems more judgmental than arguments that appeal to welfare and freedom. To ask\\nwhether a policy will speed economic recovery or spur economic growth does not involve judging\\npeople’s preferences. It assumes that everyone prefers more income rather than less, and it doesn’t\\npass judgment on how they spend their money. Similarly, to ask whether, under conditions of duress,\\npeople are actually free to choose doesn’t require evaluating their choices. The question is whether, or\\nto what extent, people are free rather than coerced.\\nThe virtue argument, by contrast, rests on a judgment that greed is a vice that the state should\\ndiscourage. But who is to judge what is virtue and what is vice? Don’t citizens of pluralist societies\\ndisagree about such things? And isn’t it dangerous to impose judgments about virtue through law? In the\\nface of these worries, many people hold that government should be neutral on matters of virtue and\\nvice; it should not try to cultivate good attitudes or discourage bad ones.\\nSo when we probe our reactions to price gouging, we find ourselves pulled in two directions: We are\\noutraged when people get \\nthings they don’t deserve; greed that preys on human misery, we think, should\\nbe punished, not rewarded. And yet we worry when judgments about virtue find their way into law.\\nThis dilemma points to one of the great questions of political philosophy: Does a just society seek to\\npromote the virtue of its citizens? Or should law be neutral toward competing conceptions of virtue, so\\nthat citizens can be free to choose for themselves the best way to live?\\nAccording to the textbook account, this question divides ancient and modern political thought. In one\\nimportant respect, the textbook is right. Aristotle teaches that justice means giving people what they\\ndeserve. And in order to determine who deserves what, we have to determine what virtues are worthy\\nof honor and reward. Aristotle maintains that we can’t figure out what a just constitution is without first\\nreflecting on the most desirable way of life. For him, law can’t be neutral on questions of the good life.\\nBy contrast, modern political philosophers—from Immanuel Kant in the eighteenth century to John\\nRawls in the twentieth century—argue that the principles of justice that define our rights should not rest\\non any particular conception of virtue, or of the best way to live. Instead, a just society respects each\\nperson’s freedom to choose his or her own conception of the good life.\\nSo you might say that ancient theories of justice start with virtue, while modern theories start with\\nfreedom. And in the chapters to come, we explore the strengths and weaknesses of each. But it’s worth\\nnoticing at the outset that this contrast can mislead.\\nFor if we turn our gaze to the arguments about justice that animate contemporary politics—not among\\nphilosophers but among ordinary men and women—we find a more complicated picture. It’s true that\\nmost of our arguments are about promoting prosperity and respecting individual freedom, at least on the\\nsurface. But underlying these arguments, and sometimes contending with them, we can often glimpse\\nanother set of convictions—about what virtues are worthy of honor and reward, and what way of life a\\ngood society should promote. Devoted \\nthough we are to prosperity and freedom, we can’t quite shake\\noff the judgmental strand of justice. The conviction that justice involves virtue as well as choice runsdeep. Thinking about justice seems inescapably to engage us in thinking about the best way to live.\\nWhat Wounds Deserve the Purple Heart?\\nOn some issues, questions of virtue and honor are too obvious to deny. Consider the recent debate\\nover who should qualify for the Purple Heart. Since 1932, the U.S. military has awarded the medal to\\nsoldiers wounded or killed in battle by enemy action. In addition to the honor, the medal entitles\\nrecipients to special privileges in veterans’ hospitals.\\nSince the beginning of the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, growing numbers of veterans have\\nbeen diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and treated for the condition. Symptoms include\\nrecurring nightmares, severe depression, and suicide. At least three hundred thousand veterans\\nreportedly suffer from traumatic stress or major depression. Advocates for these veterans have\\nproposed that they, too, should qualify for the Purple Heart. Since psychological injuries can be at least\\nas debilitating as physical ones, they argue, soldiers who suffer these wounds should receive the\\nmedal.\\n11\\nAfter a Pentagon advisory group studied the question, the Pentagon announced, in 2009, that the\\nPurple Heart would be reserved for soldiers with physical injuries. Veterans suffering from mental\\ndisorders and psychological trauma would not be eligible, even though they qualify for government-\\nsupported medical treatment and disability payments. The Pentagon offered two reasons for its\\ndecision: traumatic stress disorders are not intentionally caused by enemy action, and they are difficult\\nto diagnose objectively.\\n12\\nDid the Pentagon make the right decision? Taken by themselves, its reasons are unconvincing. In the\\nIraq War, one of the most common injuries recognized with the Purple Heart has been a punctured\\neardrum, caused by explosions at close range.\\n13\\n But unlike bullets and \\nbombs, such explosions are not\\na deliberate enemy tactic intended to injure or kill; they are (like traumatic stress) a damaging side effect\\nof battlefield action. And while traumatic disorders may be more difficult to diagnose than a broken limb,\\nthe injury they inflict can be more severe and long-lasting.\\nAs the wider debate about the Purple Heart revealed, the real issue is about the meaning of the medal\\nand the virtues it honors. What, then, are the relevant virtues? Unlike other military medals, the Purple\\nHeart honors sacrifice, not bravery. It requires no heroic act, only an injury inflicted by the enemy. The\\nquestion is what kind of injury should count.\\nA veteran’s group called the Military Order of the Purple Heart opposed awarding the medal for\\npsychological injuries, claiming that doing so would “debase” the honor. A spokesman for the group\\nstated that “shedding blood” should be an essential qualification.\\n14\\n He didn’t explain why bloodless\\ninjuries shouldn’t count. But Tyler E. Boudreau, a former Marine captain who favors including\\npsychological injuries, offers a compelling analysis of the dispute. He attributes the opposition to a\\ndeep-seated attitude in the military that views post-traumatic stress as a kind of weakness. “The same\\nculture that demands tough-mindedness also encourages skepticism toward the suggestion that the\\nviolence of war can hurt the healthiest of minds . . . Sadly, as long as our military culture bears at least a\\nquiet contempt for the psychological wounds of war, it is unlikely those veterans will ever see a Purple\\nHeart.”\\n15\\nSo the debate over the Purple Heart is more than a medical or clinical dispute about how to determine\\nthe veracity of injury. At the heart of the disagreement are rival conceptions of moral character and\\nmilitary valor. Those who insist that only bleeding wounds should count believe that post-traumatic\\nstress reflects a weakness of character unworthy of honor. Those who believe that psychological\\nwounds should qualify argue that veterans suffering long-term trauma and severe depression have\\nsacrificed for their country as surely, and as honorably, as those who’ve lost a limb.\\nThe dispute over the Purple Heart illustrates the moral logic of Aristotle’s theory of justice. We can’t\\ndetermine who deserves a military medal without asking what virtues the medal properly honors. And to\\nanswer that question, we have to assess competing conceptions of character and sacrifice.\\nIt might be argued that military medals are a special case, a throwback to an ancient ethic of honor\\nand virtue. These days, most of our arguments about justice are about how to distribute the fruits of\\nprosperity, or the burdens of hard times, and how to define the basic rights of citizens. In these domains,considerations of welfare and freedom predominate. But arguments about the rights and wrongs of\\neconomic arrangements often lead us back to Aristotle’s question of what people morally deserve, and\\nwhy.\\nBailout Outrage\\nThe public furor over the financial crisis of 2008–09 is a case in point. For years, stock prices and real\\nestate values had climbed. The reckoning came when the housing bubble burst. Wall Street banks and\\nfinancial institutions had made billions of dollars on complex investments backed by mortgages whose\\nvalue now plunged. Once proud Wall Street firms teetered on the edge of collapse. The stock market\\ntanked, devastating not only big investors but also ordinary Americans, whose retirement accounts lost\\nmuch of their value. The total wealth of American families fell by $11 trillion in 2008, an amount equal to\\nthe combined annual output of Germany, Japan, and the UK.\\n16\\nIn October 2008, President George W. Bush asked Congress for $700 billion to bail out the nation’s\\nbig banks and financial firms. It didn’t seem fair that Wall Street had enjoyed huge profits during the good\\ntimes and was now asking taxpayers to foot the bill when things had gone bad. But there seemed no\\nalternative. The banks and financial firms had grown so vast and so entwined with every aspect of the\\neconomy \\nthat their collapse might bring down the entire financial system. They were “too big to fail.”\\nNo one claimed that the banks and investment houses deserved the money. Their reckless bets\\n(enabled by inadequate government regulation) had created the crisis. But here was a case where the\\nwelfare of the economy as a whole seemed to outweigh considerations of fairness. Congress\\nreluctantly appropriated the bailout funds.\\nThen came the bonuses. Shortly after the bailout money began to flow, news accounts revealed that\\nsome of the companies now on the public dole were awarding millions of dollars in bonuses to their\\nexecutives. The most egregious case involved the American International Group (A.I.G.), an insurance\\ngiant brought to ruin by the risky investments of its financial products unit. Despite having been rescued\\nwith massive infusions of government funds (totaling $173 billion), the company paid $165 million in\\nbonuses to executives in the very division that had precipitated the crisis. Seventy-three employees\\nreceived bonuses of $1 million or more.\\n17\\nNews of the bonuses set off a firestorm of public protest. This time, the outrage was not about ten-\\ndollar bags of ice or overpriced motel rooms. It was about lavish rewards subsidized with taxpayer funds\\nto members of the division that had helped bring the global financial system to near meltdown.\\nSomething was wrong with this picture. Although the U.S. government now owned 80 percent of the\\ncompany, the treasury secretary pleaded in vain with A.I.G.’s government-appointed CEO to rescind the\\nbonuses. “We cannot attract and retain the best and the brightest talent,” the CEO replied, “if employees\\nbelieve their compensation is subject to continued and arbitrary adjustment by the U.S. Treasury.” He\\nclaimed the employees’ talents were needed to unload the toxic assets for the benefit of the taxpayers,\\nwho, after all, owned most of the company.\\n18\\nThe public reacted with fury. A full-page headline in the tabloid \\nNew York Post\\n captured the sentiments\\nof many: “Not So Fast You Greedy \\nBastards.”\\n19\\n The U.S. House of Representatives sought to claw\\nback the payments by approving a bill that would impose a 90 percent tax on bonuses paid to\\nemployees of companies that received substantial bailout funds.\\n20\\n Under pressure from New York\\nattorney general Andrew Cuomo, fifteen of the top twenty A.I.G. bonus recipients agreed to return the\\npayments, and some $50 million was recouped in all.\\n21\\n This gesture assuaged public anger to some\\ndegree, and support for the punitive tax measure faded in the Senate.\\n22\\n But the episode left the public\\nreluctant to spend more to clean up the mess the financial industry had created.\\nAt the heart of the bailout outrage was a sense of injustice. Even before the bonus issue erupted,\\npublic support for the bailout was hesitant and conflicted. Americans were torn between the need to\\nprevent an economic meltdown that would hurt everyone and their belief that funneling massive sums to\\nfailed banks and investment companies was deeply unfair. To avoid economic disaster, Congress and\\nthe public acceded. But morally speaking, it had felt all along like a kind of extortion.\\nUnderlying the bailout outrage was a belief about moral desert: The executives receiving the bonuses(and the companies receiving the bailouts) didn’t deserve them. But why didn’t they? The reason may be\\nless obvious than it seems. Consider two possible answers—one is about greed, the other about failure.\\nOne source of outrage was that the bonuses seemed to reward greed, as the tabloid headline\\nindelicately suggested. The public found this morally unpalatable. Not only the bonuses but the bailout as\\na whole seemed, perversely, to reward greedy behavior rather than punish it. The derivatives traders\\nhad landed their company, and the country, in dire financial peril—by making reckless investments in\\npursuit of ever-greater profits. Having pocketed the profits when times were good, they saw nothing\\nwrong with million-dollar bonuses even after their investments had come to ruin.\\n23\\nThe greed critique was voiced not only by the tabloids, but also (in more decorous versions) by public\\nofficials. Senator Sherrod Brown \\n(D-Ohio) said that A.I.G.’s behavior “smacks of greed, arrogance, and\\nworse.”\\n24\\n President Obama stated that A.I.G. “finds itself in financial distress due to recklessness and\\ngreed.”\\n25\\nThe problem with the greed critique is that it doesn’t distinguish the rewards bestowed by the bailout\\nafter the crash from the rewards bestowed by markets when times were flush. Greed is a vice, a bad\\nattitude, an excessive, single-minded desire for gain. So it’s understandable that people aren’t keen to\\nreward it. But is there any reason to assume that the recipients of bailout bonuses are any greedier now\\nthan they were a few years ago, when they were riding high and reaping even greater rewards?\\nWall Street traders, bankers, and hedge fund managers are a hard-charging lot. The pursuit of\\nfinancial gain is what they do for a living. Whether or not their vocation taints their character, their virtue\\nis unlikely to rise or fall with the stock market. So if it’s wrong to reward greed with big bailout bonuses,\\nisn’t it also wrong to reward it with market largess? The public was outraged when, in 2008, Wall Street\\nfirms (some on taxpayer-subsidized life support) handed out $16 billion in bonuses. But this figure was\\nless than half the amounts paid out in 2006 ($34 billion) and 2007 ($33 billion).\\n26\\n If greed is the reason\\nthey don’t deserve the money now, on what basis can it be said they deserved the money then?\\nOne obvious difference is that bailout bonuses come from the taxpayer while the bonuses paid in\\ngood times come from company earnings. If the outrage is based on the conviction that the bonuses are\\nundeserved, however, the source of the payment is not morally decisive. But it does provide a clue: the\\nreason the bonuses are coming from the taxpayer is that the companies have failed. This takes us to\\nthe heart of the complaint. The American public’s real objection to the bonuses—and the bailout—is not\\nthat they reward greed but that they reward failure.\\nAmericans are harder on failure than on greed. In market-driven societies, ambitious people are\\nexpected to pursue their interests vigorously, \\nand the line between self-interest and greed often blurs.\\nBut the line between success and failure is etched more sharply. And the idea that people deserve the\\nrewards that success bestows is central to the American dream.\\nNotwithstanding his passing reference to greed, President Obama understood that rewarding failure\\nwas the deeper source of dissonance and outrage. In announcing limits on executive pay at companies\\nreceiving bailout funds, Obama identified the real source of bailout outrage:\\nThis is America. We don’t disparage wealth. We don’t begrudge anybody for achieving\\nsuccess. And we certainly believe that success should be rewarded. But what gets people\\nupset—and rightfully so—are executives being rewarded for failure, especially when those\\nrewards are subsidized by U.S. taxpayers.\\n27\\nOne of the most bizarre statements about bailout ethics came from Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa),\\na fiscal conservative from the heartland. At the height of the bonus furor, Grassley said in an Iowa radio\\ninterview that what bothered him most was the refusal of the corporate executives to take any blame for\\ntheir failures. He would “feel a bit better towards them if they would follow the Japanese example and\\ncome before the American people and take that deep bow and say, ‘I’m sorry,’ and then either do one of\\ntwo things—resign or go commit suicide.”\\n28\\nGrassley later explained that he was not calling on the executives to commit suicide. But he did want\\nthem to accept responsibility for their failure, to show contrition, and to offer a public apology. “I haven’t\\nheard this from CEOs, and it just makes it very difficult for the taxpayers of my district to just keep\\nshoveling money out the door.”\\n29Grassley’s comments support my hunch that the bailout anger was not mainly about greed; what most\\noffended Americans’ sense of justice was that their tax dollars were being used to reward failure.\\nIf that’s right, it remains to ask whether this view of the bailouts was justified. Were the CEOs and top\\nexecutives of the big banks and investment firms really to blame for the financial crisis? Many of the\\nexecutives didn’t think so. Testifying before congressional committees investigating the financial crisis,\\nthey insisted they had done all they could with the information available to them. The former chief\\nexecutive of Bear Stearns, a Wall Street investment firm that collapsed in 2008, said he’d pondered\\nlong and hard whether he could have done anything differently. He concluded he’d done all he could. “I\\njust simply have not been able to come up with anything . . . that would have made a difference to the\\nsituation we faced.”\\n30\\nOther CEOs of failed companies agreed, insisting that they were victims “of a financial tsunami”\\nbeyond their control.\\n31\\n A similar attitude extended to young traders, who had a hard time understanding\\nthe public’s fury about their bonuses. “There’s no sympathy for us anywhere,” a Wall Street trader told a\\nreporter for \\nVanity Fair\\n. “But it’s not as if we weren’t working hard.”\\n32\\nThe tsunami metaphor became part of bailout vernacular, especially in financial circles. If the\\nexecutives are right that the failure of their companies was due to larger economic forces, not their own\\ndecisions, this would explain why they didn’t express the remorse that Senator Grassley wanted to hear.\\nBut it also raises a far-reaching question about failure, success, and justice.\\nIf big, systemic economic forces account for the disastrous loses of 2008 and 2009, couldn’t it be\\nargued that they also account for the dazzling gains of earlier years? If the weather is to blame for the\\nbad years, how can it be that the talent, wisdom, and hard work of bankers, traders, and Wall Street\\nexecutives are responsible for the stupendous returns that occurred when the sun was shining?\\nConfronted with public outrage over paying bonuses for failure, the CEOs argued that financial returns\\nare not wholly their own doing, but the product of forces beyond their control. They may have a point.\\nBut if this is true, there’s good reason to question their claim to out-sized compensation when times are\\ngood. Surely the end of the cold war, the globalization of trade and capital markets, the rise of personal\\ncomputers and the Internet, and a host of other factors help explain the success of the financial industry\\nduring its run in the 1990s and in the early years of the twenty-first century.\\nIn 2007, CEOs at major U.S. corporations were paid 344 times the pay of the average worker.\\n33\\n On\\nwhat grounds, if any, do executives deserve to make that much more than their employees? Most of\\nthem work hard and bring talent to their work. But consider this: In 1980, CEOs earned only 42 times\\nwhat their workers did.\\n34\\n Were executives less talented and hardworking in 1980 than they are today?\\nOr do pay differentials reflect contingencies unrelated to talents and skills?\\nOr compare the level of executive compensation in the United States with that in other countries.\\nCEOs at top U.S. companies earn an average of $13.3 million per year (using 2004–2006 data),\\ncompared to $6.6 million for European chief executives and $1.5 million for CEOs in Japan.\\n35\\n Are\\nAmerican executives twice as deserving as their European counterparts, and nine times as deserving\\nas Japanese CEOs? Or do these differences also reflect factors unrelated to the effort and talent that\\nexecutives bring to their jobs?\\nThe bailout outrage that gripped the United States in early 2009 expressed the widely held view that\\npeople who wreck the companies they run with risky investments don’t deserve to be rewarded with\\nmillions of dollars in bonuses. But the argument over the bonuses raises questions about who deserves\\nwhat when times are good. Do the successful deserve the bounty that markets bestow upon them, or\\ndoes that bounty depend on factors beyond their control? And what are the implications for the mutual\\nobligations of citizens—in good times and hard times? Whether the financial crisis will prompt public\\ndebate on these broader questions remains to be seen.\\nThree Approaches to Justice\\nTo ask whether a society is just is to ask how it distributes the things we prize—income and wealth,\\nduties and rights, powers and opportunities, offices and honors. A just society distributes these goods in\\nthe right way; it gives each person his or her due. The hard questions begin when we ask what peopleare due, and why.\\nWe’ve already begun to wrestle with these questions. As we’ve pondered the rights and wrongs of\\nprice gouging, competing claims to the Purple Heart, and financial bailouts, we’ve identified three ways\\nof approaching the distribution of goods: welfare, freedom, and virtue. Each of these ideals suggests a\\ndifferent way of thinking about justice.\\nSome of our debates reflect disagreement about what it means to maximize welfare or respect\\nfreedom or cultivate virtue. Others involve disagreement about what to do when these ideals conflict.\\nPolitical philosophy cannot resolve these disagreements once and for all. But it can give shape to the\\narguments we have, and bring moral clarity to the alternatives we confront as democratic citizens.\\nThis book explores the strengths and weaknesses of these three ways of thinking about justice. We\\nbegin with the idea of maximizing welfare. For market societies such as ours, it offers a natural starting\\npoint. Much contemporary political debate is about how to promote prosperity, or improve our standard\\nof living, or spur economic growth. Why do we care about these things? The most obvious answer is\\nthat we think prosperity makes us better off than we would otherwise be—as individuals and as a\\nsociety. Prosperity matters, in other words, because it contributes to our welfare. To explore this idea,\\nwe turn to utilitarianism, the most influential account of how and why we should maximize welfare, or (as\\nthe utilitarians put it) seek the greatest happiness for the greatest number.\\nNext, we take up a range of theories that connect justice to freedom. Most of these theories\\nemphasize respect for individual rights, \\nthough they disagree among themselves about which rights are\\nmost important. The idea that justice means respecting freedom and individual rights is at least as\\nfamiliar in contemporary politics as the utilitarian idea of maximizing welfare. For example, the U.S. Bill\\nof Rights sets out certain liberties—including rights to freedom of speech and religious liberty—that\\neven majorities may not violate. And around the world, the idea that justice means respecting certain\\nuniversal human rights is increasingly embraced (in theory, if not always in practice).\\nThe approach to justice that begins with freedom is a capacious school. In fact, some of the most\\nhard-fought political arguments of our time take place between two rival camps within it—the laissez-\\nfaire camp and the fairness camp. Leading the laissez-faire camp are free-market libertarians who\\nbelieve that justice consists in respecting and upholding the voluntary choices made by consenting\\nadults. The fairness camp contains theorists of a more egalitarian bent. They argue that unfettered\\nmarkets are neither just nor free. In their view, justice requires policies that remedy social and economic\\ndisadvantages and give everyone a fair chance at success.\\nFinally, we turn to theories that see justice as bound up with virtue and the good life. In contemporary\\npolitics, virtue theories are often identified with cultural conservatives and the religious right. The idea of\\nlegislating morality is anathema to many citizens of liberal societies, as it risks lapsing into intolerance\\nand coercion. But the notion that a just society affirms certain virtues and conceptions of the good life\\nhas inspired political movements and arguments across the ideological spectrum. Not only the Taliban,\\nbut also abolitionists and Martin Luther King, Jr., have drawn their visions of justice from moral and\\nreligious ideals.\\nBefore attempting to assess these theories of justice, it’s worth asking how philosophical arguments\\ncan proceed—especially in so contested a domain as moral and political philosophy. They often begin\\nwith concrete situations. As we’ve seen in our discussion of price gouging, Purple Hearts, and bailouts,\\nmoral and political reflection finds its occasion in disagreement. Often the disagreements are among\\npartisans \\nor rival advocates in the public realm. Sometimes the disagreements are within us as\\nindividuals, as when we find ourselves torn or conflicted about a hard moral question.\\nBut how exactly can we reason our way from the judgments we make about concrete situations to the\\nprinciples of justice we believe should apply in all situations? What, in short, does moral reasoning\\nconsist in?\\nTo see how moral reasoning can proceed, let’s turn to two situations—one a fanciful hypothetical\\nstory much discussed by philosophers, the other an actual story about an excruciating moral dilemma.\\nConsider first this philosopher’s hypothetical.\\n36\\n Like all such tales, it involves a scenario stripped of\\nmany realistic complexities, so that we can focus on a limited number of philosophical issues.\\nThe Runaway TrolleySuppose you are the driver of a trolley car hurtling down the track at sixty miles an hour. Up ahead you\\nsee five workers standing on the track, tools in hand. You try to stop, but you can’t. The brakes don’t\\nwork. You feel desperate, because you know that if you crash into these five workers, they will all die.\\n(Let’s assume you know that for sure.)\\nSuddenly, you notice a side track, off to the right. There is a worker on that track, too, but only one.\\nYou realize that you can turn the trolley car onto the side track, killing the one worker, but sparing the\\nfive.\\nWhat should you do? Most people would say, “Turn! Tragic though it is to kill one innocent person, it’s\\neven worse to kill five.” Sacrificing one life in order to save five does seem the right thing to do.\\nNow consider another version of the trolley story. This time, you are not the driver but an onlooker,\\nstanding on a bridge overlooking the track. (This time, there is no side track.) Down the track comes a\\ntrolley, and at the end of the track are five workers. Once again, the brakes don’t work. The trolley is\\nabout to crash into the five workers. You feel helpless to avert this disaster—until you notice, standing\\nnext to you on the bridge, a very heavy man. You could push him off the \\nbridge, onto the track, into the\\npath of the oncoming trolley. He would die, but the five workers would be saved. (You consider jumping\\nonto the track yourself, but realize you are too small to stop the trolley.)\\nWould pushing the heavy man onto the track be the right thing to do? Most people would say, “Of\\ncourse not. It would be terribly wrong to push the man onto the track.”\\nPushing someone off a bridge to a certain death does seem an awful thing to do, even if it saves five\\ninnocent lives. But this raises a moral puzzle: Why does the principle that seems right in the first case—\\nsacrifice one life to save five—seem wrong in the second?\\nIf, as our reaction to the first case suggests, numbers count—if it is better to save five lives than one\\n—then why shouldn’t we apply this principle in the second case, and push? It does seem cruel to push a\\nman to his death, even for a good cause. But is it any less cruel to kill a man by crashing into him with a\\ntrolley car?\\nPerhaps the reason it is wrong to push is that doing so uses the man on the bridge against his will. He\\ndidn’t choose to be involved, after all. He was just standing there.\\nBut the same could be said of the person working on the side track. He didn’t choose to be involved,\\neither. He was just doing his job, not volunteering to sacrifice his life in the event of a runaway trolley. It\\nmight be argued that railway workers willingly incur a risk that bystanders do not. But let’s assume that\\nbeing willing to die in an emergency to save other people’s lives is not part of the job description, and\\nthat the worker has no more consented to give his life than the bystander on the bridge has consented\\nto give his.\\nMaybe the moral difference lies not in the effect on the victims—both wind up dead—but in the\\nintention of the person making the decision. As the driver of the trolley, you might defend your choice to\\ndivert the trolley by pointing out that you didn’t \\nintend\\n the death of the worker on the side track,\\nforeseeable though it was; your purpose would still have been achieved if, by a great stroke of luck, the\\nfive workers were spared and the sixth also managed to survive.\\nBut the same is true in the pushing case. The death of the man you push off the bridge is not essential\\nto your purpose. All he needs to do is block the trolley; if he can do so and somehow survive, you would\\nbe delighted.\\nOr perhaps, on reflection, the two cases should be governed by the same principle. Both involve a\\ndeliberate choice to take the life of one innocent person in order to prevent an even greater loss of life.\\nPerhaps your reluctance to push the man off the bridge is mere squeamishness, a hesitation you should\\novercome. Pushing a man to his death with your bare hands does seem more cruel than turning the\\nsteering wheel of a trolley. But doing the right thing is not always easy.\\nWe can test this idea by altering the story slightly. Suppose you, as the onlooker, could cause the\\nlarge man standing next to you to fall onto the track without pushing him; imagine he is standing on a\\ntrap door that you could open by turning a steering wheel. No pushing, same result. Would that make it\\nthe right thing to do? Or is it still morally worse than for you, as the trolley driver, to turn onto the side\\ntrack?\\nIt is not easy to explain the moral difference between these cases—why turning the trolley seems\\nright, but pushing the man off the bridge seems wrong. But notice the pressure we feel to reason our\\nway to a convincing distinction between them—and if we cannot, to reconsider our judgment about the\\nright thing to do in each case. We sometimes think of moral reasoning as a way of persuading otherpeople. But it is also a way of sorting out our own moral convictions, of figuring out what we believe and\\nwhy.\\nSome moral dilemmas arise from conflicting moral principles. For example, one principle that comes\\ninto play in the trolley story says we should save as many lives as possible, but another says it is wrong\\nto kill an innocent person, even for a good cause. Confronted with a situation in which saving a number\\nof lives depends on killing an innocent person, we face a moral quandary. We must try to figure out\\nwhich principle has greater weight, or is more appropriate under the circumstances.\\nOther moral dilemmas arise because we are uncertain how events will unfold. Hypothetical examples\\nsuch as the trolley story remove the uncertainty that hangs over the choices we confront in real life.\\nThey assume we know for sure how many will die if we don’t turn—or don’t push. This makes such\\nstories imperfect guides to action. But it also makes them useful devices for moral analysis. By setting\\naside contingencies—“What if the workers noticed the trolley and jumped aside in time?”—hypothetical\\nexamples help us to isolate the moral principles at stake and examine their force.\\nThe Afghan Goatherds\\nConsider now an actual moral dilemma, similar in some ways to the fanciful tale of the runaway trolley,\\nbut complicated by uncertainty about how things will turn out:\\nIn June 2005, a special forces team made up of Petty Officer Marcus Luttrell and three other U.S.\\nNavy SEALs set out on a secret reconnaissance mission in Afghanistan, near the Pakistan border, in\\nsearch of a Taliban leader, a close associate of Osama bin Laden.\\n37\\n According to intelligence reports,\\ntheir target commanded 140 to 150 heavily armed fighters and was staying in a village in the forbidding\\nmountainous region.\\nShortly after the special forces team took up a position on a mountain ridge overlooking the village,\\ntwo Afghan farmers with about a hundred bleating goats happened upon them. With them was a boy\\nabout fourteen years old. The Afghans were unarmed. The American soldiers trained their rifles on them,\\nmotioned for them to sit on the ground, and then debated what to do about them. On the one hand, the\\ngoatherds appeared to be unarmed civilians. On the other hand, letting them go would run the risk that\\nthey would inform the Taliban of the presence of the U.S. soldiers.\\nAs the four soldiers contemplated their options, they realized that they didn’t have any rope, so tying\\nup the Afghans to allow time to find \\na new hideout was not feasible. The only choice was to kill them or\\nlet them go free.\\nOne of Luttrell’s comrades argued for killing the goatherds: “We’re on active duty behind enemy lines,\\nsent here by our senior commanders. We have a right to do everything we can to save our own lives.\\nThe military decision is obvious. To turn them loose would be wrong.”\\n38\\n Luttrell was torn. “In my soul, I\\nknew he was right,” he wrote in retrospect. “We could not possibly turn them loose. But my trouble is, I\\nhave another soul. My Christian soul. And it was crowding in on me. Something kept whispering in the\\nback of my mind, it would be wrong to execute these unarmed men in cold blood.”\\n39\\n Luttrell didn’t say\\nwhat he meant by his Christian soul, but in the end, his conscience didn’t allow him to kill the goatherds.\\nHe cast the deciding vote to release them. (One of his three comrades had abstained.) It was a vote he\\ncame to regret.\\nAbout an hour and a half after they released the goatherds, the four soldiers found themselves\\nsurrounded by eighty to a hundred Taliban fighters armed with AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenades. In\\nthe fierce firefight that followed, all three of Luttrell’s comrades were killed. The Taliban fighters also shot\\ndown a U.S. helicopter that sought to rescue the SEAL unit, killing all sixteen soldiers on board.\\nLuttrell, severely injured, managed to survive by falling down the mountainside and crawling seven\\nmiles to a Pashtun village, whose residents protected him from the Taliban until he was rescued.\\nIn retrospect, Luttrell condemned his own vote not to kill the goatherds. “It was the stupidest, most\\nsouthern-fried, lamebrained decision I ever made in my life,” he wrote in a book about the experience. “I\\nmust have been out of my mind. I had actually cast a vote which I knew could sign our death warrant. . .\\n. At least, that’s how I look back on those moments now. . . . The deciding vote was mine, and it will\\nhaunt me till they rest me in an East Texas grave.”\\n40\\nPart of what made the soldiers’ dilemma so difficult was uncertainty about what would happen if theyreleased the Afghans. Would \\nthey simply go on their way, or would they alert the Taliban? But suppose\\nLuttrell knew that freeing the goatherds would lead to a devastating battle resulting in the loss of his\\ncomrades, nineteen American deaths, injury to himself, and the failure of his mission? Would he have\\ndecided differently?\\nFor Luttrell, looking back, the answer is clear: he should have killed the goatherds. Given the disaster\\nthat followed, it is hard to disagree. From the standpoint of numbers, Luttrell’s choice is similar to the\\ntrolley case. Killing the three Afghans would have saved the lives of his three comrades and the sixteen\\nU.S. troops who tried to rescue them. But which version of the trolley story does it resemble? Would\\nkilling the goatherds be more like turning the trolley or pushing the man off the bridge? The fact that\\nLuttrell anticipated the danger and still could not bring himself to kill unarmed civilians in cold blood\\nsuggests it may be closer to the pushing case.\\nAnd yet the case for killing the goatherds seems somehow stronger than the case for pushing the man\\noff the bridge. This may be because we suspect that—given the outcome—they were not innocent\\nbystanders, but Taliban sympathizers. Consider an analogy: If we had reason to believe that the man on\\nthe bridge was responsible for disabling the brakes of the trolley in hopes of killing the workers on the\\ntrack (let’s say they were his enemies), the moral argument for pushing him onto the track would begin\\nto look stronger. We would still need to know who his enemies were, and why he wanted to kill them. If\\nwe learned that the workers on the track were members of the French resistance and the heavy man on\\nthe bridge a Nazi who had sought to kill them by disabling the trolley, the case for pushing him to save\\nthem would become morally compelling.\\nIt is possible, of course, that the Afghan goatherds were not Taliban sympathizers, but neutrals in the\\nconflict, or even Taliban opponents, who were forced by the Taliban to reveal the presence of the\\nAmerican troops. Suppose Luttrell and his comrades knew for certain that the goatherds meant them no\\nharm, but would be tortured by the Taliban \\nto reveal their location. The Americans might have killed the\\ngoatherds to protect their mission and themselves. But the decision to do so would have been more\\nwrenching (and morally more questionable) than if they knew the goatherds to be pro-Taliban spies.\\nMoral Dilemmas\\nFew of us face choices as fateful as those that confronted the soldiers on the mountain or the witness\\nto the runaway trolley. But wrestling with their dilemmas sheds light on the way moral argument can\\nproceed, in our personal lives and in the public square.\\nLife in democratic societies is rife with disagreement about right and wrong, justice and injustice.\\nSome people favor abortion rights, and others consider abortion to be murder. Some believe fairness\\nrequires taxing the rich to help the poor, while others believe it is unfair to tax away money people have\\nearned through their own efforts. Some defend affirmative action in college admissions as a way of\\nrighting past wrongs, whereas others consider it an unfair form of reverse discrimination against people\\nwho deserve admission on their merits. Some people reject the torture of terror suspects as a moral\\nabomination unworthy of a free society, while others defend it as a last resort to prevent a terrorist\\nattack.\\nElections are won and lost on these disagreements. The so-called culture wars are fought over them.\\nGiven the passion and intensity with which we debate moral questions in public life, we might be tempted\\nto think that our moral convictions are fixed once and for all, by upbringing or faith, beyond the reach of\\nreason.\\nBut if this were true, moral persuasion would be inconceivable, and what we take to be public debate\\nabout justice and rights would be nothing more than a volley of dogmatic assertions, an ideological food\\nfight.\\nAt its worst, our politics comes close to this condition. But it need not be this way. Sometimes, an\\nargument can change our minds.\\nHow, then, can we reason our way through the contested terrain of justice and injustice, equality and\\ninequality, individual rights and the common good? This book tries to answer that question.\\nOne way to begin is to notice how moral reflection emerges naturally from an encounter with a hard\\nmoral question. We start with an opinion, or a conviction, about the right thing to do: “Turn the trolley\\nonto the side track.” Then we reflect on the reason for our conviction, and seek out the principle onwhich it is based: “Better to sacrifice one life to avoid the death of many.” Then, confronted with a\\nsituation that confounds the principle, we are pitched into confusion: “I thought it was always right to\\nsave as many lives as possible, and yet it seems wrong to push the man off the bridge (or to kill the\\nunarmed goatherds).” Feeling the force of that confusion, and the pressure to sort it out, is the impulse\\nto philosophy.\\nConfronted with this tension, we may revise our judgment about the right thing to do, or rethink the\\nprinciple we initially espoused. As we encounter new situations, we move back and forth between our\\njudgments and our principles, revising each in light of the other. This turning of mind, from the world of\\naction to the realm of reasons and back again, is what moral reflection consists in.\\nThis way of conceiving moral argument, as a dialectic between our judgments about particular\\nsituations and the principles we affirm on reflection, has a long tradition. It goes back to the dialogues of\\nSocrates and the moral philosophy of Aristotle. But notwithstanding its ancient lineage, it is open to the\\nfollowing challenge:\\nIf moral reflection consists in seeking a fit between the judgments we make and the principles we\\naffirm, how can such reflection lead us to justice, or moral truth? Even if we succeed, over a lifetime, in\\nbringing our moral intuitions and principled commitments into alignment, what confidence can we have\\nthat the result is anything more than a self-consistent skein of prejudice?\\nThe answer is that moral reflection is not a solitary pursuit but a public endeavor. It requires an\\ninterlocutor—a friend, a neighbor, a \\ncomrade, a fellow citizen. Sometimes the interlocutor can be\\nimagined rather than real, as when we argue with ourselves. But we cannot discover the meaning of\\njustice or the best way to live through introspection alone.\\nIn Plato’s \\nRepublic\\n, Socrates compares ordinary citizens to a group of prisoners confined in a cave.\\nAll they ever see is the play of shadows on the wall, a reflection of objects they can never apprehend.\\nOnly the philosopher, in this account, is able to ascend from the cave to the bright light of day, where he\\nsees things as they really are. Socrates suggests that, having glimpsed the sun, only the philosopher is\\nfit to rule the cave dwellers, if he can somehow be coaxed back into the darkness where they live.\\nPlato’s point is that to grasp the meaning of justice and the nature of the good life, we must rise above\\nthe prejudices and routines of everyday life. He is right, I think, but only in part. The claims of the cave\\nmust be given their due. If moral reflection is dialectical—if it moves back and forth between the\\njudgments we make in concrete situations and the principles that inform those judgments—it needs\\nopinions and convictions, however partial and untutored, as ground and grist. A philosophy untouched by\\nthe shadows on the wall can only yield a sterile utopia.\\nWhen moral reflection turns political, when it asks what laws should govern our collective life, it needs\\nsome engagement with the tumult of the city, with the arguments and incidents that roil the public mind.\\nDebates over bailouts and price gouging, income inequality and affirmative action, military service and\\nsame-sex marriage, are the stuff of political philosophy. They prompt us to articulate and justify our\\nmoral and political convictions, not only among family and friends but also in the demanding company of\\nour fellow citizens.\\nMore demanding still is the company of political philosophers, ancient and modern, who thought\\nthrough, in sometimes radical and surprising ways, the ideas that animate civic life—justice and rights,\\nobligation and consent, honor and virtue, morality and law. Aristotle, \\nImmanuel Kant, John Stuart Mill,\\nand John Rawls all figure in these pages. But their order of appearance is not chronological. This book\\nis not a history of ideas, but a journey in moral and political reflection. Its goal is not to show who\\ninfluenced whom in the history of political thought, but to invite readers to subject their own views about\\njustice to critical examination—to figure out what they think, and why.2. THE GREATEST HAPPINESS PRINCIPLE / UTILITARIANISM\\nIn the summer of 1884,\\n four English sailors were stranded at sea in a small lifeboat in the South\\nAtlantic, over a thousand miles from land. Their ship, the \\nMignonette\\n, had gone down in a storm, and\\nthey had escaped to the lifeboat, with only two cans of preserved turnips and no fresh water. Thomas\\nDudley was the captain, Edwin Stephens was the first mate, and Edmund Brooks was a sailor—“all men\\nof excellent character,” according to newspaper accounts.\\n1\\nThe fourth member of the crew was the cabin boy, Richard Parker, age seventeen. He was an\\norphan, on his first long voyage at sea. He had signed up against the advice of his friends, “in the\\nhopefulness of youthful ambition,” thinking the journey would make a man of him. Sadly, it was not to be.\\nFrom the lifeboat, the four stranded sailors watched the horizon, hoping a ship might pass and rescue\\nthem. For the first three days, they ate small rations of turnips. On the fourth day, they caught a turtle.\\nThey subsisted on the turtle and the remaining turnips for the next few days. And then for eight days,\\nthey ate nothing.\\nBy now Parker, the cabin boy, was lying in the corner of the lifeboat. He had drunk seawater, against\\nthe advice of the others, and become ill. He appeared to be dying. On the nineteenth day of their ordeal,\\nDudley, the captain, suggested drawing lots to determine who \\nwould die so that the others might live.\\nBut Brooks refused, and no lots were drawn.\\nThe next day came, and still no ship was in sight. Dudley told Brooks to avert his gaze and motioned\\nto Stephens that Parker had to be killed. Dudley offered a prayer, told the boy his time had come, and\\nthen killed him with a penknife, stabbing him in the jugular vein. Brooks emerged from his conscientious\\nobjection to share in the gruesome bounty. For four days, the three men fed on the body and blood of\\nthe cabin boy.\\nAnd then help came. Dudley describes their rescue in his diary, with staggering euphemism: “On the\\n24th day, as we were having our breakfast,” a ship appeared at last. The three survivors were picked\\nup. Upon their return to England, they were arrested and tried. Brooks turned state’s witness. Dudley\\nand Stephens went to trial. They freely confessed that they had killed and eaten Parker. They claimed\\nthey had done so out of necessity.\\nSuppose you were the judge. How would you rule? To simplify things, put aside the question of law\\nand assume that you were asked to decide whether killing the cabin boy was morally permissible.\\nThe strongest argument for the defense is that, given the dire circumstances, it was necessary to kill\\none person in order to save three. Had no one been killed and eaten, all four would likely have died.\\nParker, weakened and ill, was the logical candidate, since he would soon have died anyway. And unlike\\nDudley and Stephens, he had no dependents. His death deprived no one of support and left no grieving\\nwife or children.\\nThis argument is open to at least two objections: First, it can be asked whether the benefits of killing\\nthe cabin boy, taken as a whole, really did outweigh the costs. Even counting the number of lives saved\\nand the happiness of the survivors and their families, allowing such a killing might have bad\\nconsequences for society as a whole—weakening the norm against murder, for example, or increasing\\npeople’s tendency \\nto take the law into their own hands, or making it more difficult for captains to recruit\\ncabin boys.\\nSecond, even if, all things considered, the benefits do outweigh the costs, don’t we have a nagging\\nsense that killing and eating a defenseless cabin boy is wrong for reasons that go beyond the\\ncalculation of social costs and benefits? Isn’t it wrong to use a human being in this way—exploiting his\\nvulnerability, taking his life without his consent—even if doing so benefits others?\\nTo anyone appalled by the actions of Dudley and Stephens, the first objection will seem a tepid\\ncomplaint. It accepts the utilitarian assumption that morality consists in weighing costs and benefits, and\\nsimply wants a fuller reckoning of the social consequences.\\nIf the killing of the cabin boy is worthy of moral outrage, the second objection is more to the point. It\\nrejects the idea that the right thing to do is simply a matter of calculating consequences—costs and\\nbenefits. It suggests that morality means something more—something to do with the proper way for\\nhuman beings to treat one another.These two ways of thinking about the lifeboat case illustrate two rival approaches to justice. The first\\napproach says the morality of an action depends solely on the consequences it brings about; the right\\nthing to do is whatever will produce the best state of affairs, all things considered. The second approach\\nsays that consequences are not all we should care about, morally speaking; certain duties and rights\\nshould command our respect, for reasons independent of the social consequences.\\nIn order to resolve the lifeboat case, as well as many less extreme dilemmas we commonly\\nencounter, we need to explore some big questions of moral and political philosophy: Is morality a matter\\nof counting lives and weighing costs and benefits, or are certain moral duties and human rights so\\nfundamental that they rise above such calculations? And if certain rights are fundamental in this way—\\nbe they natural, or sacred, or inalienable, or categorical—how can we identify them? And what makes\\nthem fundamental?\\nJeremy Bentham’s Utilitarianism\\nJeremy Bentham (1748–1832) left no doubt where he stood on this question. He heaped scorn on the\\nidea of natural rights, calling them “nonsense upon stilts.” The philosophy he launched has had an\\ninfluential career. In fact, it exerts a powerful hold on the thinking of policy-makers, economists,\\nbusiness executives, and ordinary citizens to this day.\\nBentham, an English moral philosopher and legal reformer, founded the doctrine of utilitarianism. Its\\nmain idea is simply stated and intuitively appealing: The highest principle of morality is to maximize\\nhappiness, the overall balance of pleasure over pain. According to Bentham, the right thing to do is\\nwhatever will maximize utility. By “utility,” he means whatever produces pleasure or happiness, and\\nwhatever prevents pain or suffering.\\nBentham arrives at his principle by the following line of reasoning: We are all governed by the feelings\\nof pain and pleasure. They are our “sovereign masters.” They govern us in everything we do and also\\ndetermine what we ought to do. The standard of right and wrong is “fastened to their throne.”\\n2\\nWe all like pleasure and dislike pain. The utilitarian philosophy recognizes this fact, and makes it the\\nbasis of moral and political life. Maximizing utility is a principle not only for individuals but also for\\nlegislators. In deciding what laws or policies to enact, a government should do whatever will maximize\\nthe happiness of the community as a whole. What, after all, is a community? According to Bentham, it is\\n“a fictitious body,” composed of the sum of the individuals who comprise it. Citizens and legislators\\nshould therefore ask themselves this question: If we add up all of the benefits of this policy, and subtract\\nall the costs, will it produce more happiness than the alternative?\\nBentham’s argument for the principle that we should maximize utility takes the form of a bold\\nassertion: There are no possible grounds for rejecting it. Every moral argument, he claims, must\\nimplicitly draw on the idea of maximizing happiness. People may say they believe in certain \\nabsolute,\\ncategorical duties or rights. But they would have no basis for defending these duties or rights unless\\nthey believed that respecting them would maximize human happiness, at least in the long run.\\n“When a man attempts to combat the principle of utility,” Bentham writes, “it is with reasons drawn,\\nwithout his being aware of it, from that very principle itself.” All moral quarrels, properly understood, are\\ndisagreements about how to apply the utilitarian principle of maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain, not\\nabout the principle itself. “Is it possible for a man to move the earth?” Bentham asks. “Yes; but he must\\nfirst find out another earth to stand upon.” And the only earth, the only premise, the only starting point for\\nmoral argument, according to Bentham, is the principle of utility.\\n3\\nBentham thought his utility principle offered a science of morality that could serve as the basis of\\npolitical reform. He proposed a number of projects designed to make penal policy more efficient and\\nhumane. One was the Panopticon, a prison with a central inspection tower that would enable the\\nsupervisor to observe the inmates without their seeing him. He suggested that the Panopticon be run by\\na private contractor (ideally himself), who would manage the prison in exchange for the profits to be\\nmade from the labor of the convicts, who would work sixteen hours per day. Although Bentham’s plan\\nwas ultimately rejected, it was arguably ahead of its time. Recent years have seen a revival, in the\\nUnited States and Britain, of the idea of outsourcing prisons to private companies.Rounding up beggars\\nAnother of Bentham’s schemes was a plan to improve “pauper management” by establishing a self-\\nfinancing workhouse for the poor. The plan, which sought to reduce the presence of beggars on the\\nstreets, offers a vivid illustration of the utilitarian logic. Bentham observed, first of all, that encountering\\nbeggars on the streets reduces the happiness of passersby, in two ways. For tenderhearted souls, the\\nsight of a beggar produces \\nthe pain of sympathy; for hardhearted folk, it generates the pain of disgust.\\nEither way, encountering beggars reduces the utility of the general public. So Bentham proposed\\nremoving beggars from the streets and confining them in a workhouse.\\n4\\nSome may think this unfair to the beggars. But Bentham does not neglect their utility. He\\nacknowledges that some beggars would be happier begging than working in a poorhouse. But he notes\\nthat for every happy and prosperous beggar, there are many miserable ones. He concludes that the sum\\nof the pains suffered by the public is greater than whatever unhappiness is felt by beggars hauled off to\\nthe workhouse.\\n5\\nSome might worry that building and running the workhouse would impose an expense on taxpayers,\\nreducing their happiness and thus their utility. But Bentham proposed a way to make his pauper\\nmanagement plan entirely self-financing. Any citizen who encountered a beggar would be empowered to\\napprehend him and take him to the nearest workhouse. Once confined there, each beggar would have to\\nwork to pay off the cost of his or her maintenance, which would be tallied in a “self-liberation account.”\\nThe account would include food, clothing, bedding, medical care, and a life insurance policy, in case the\\nbeggar died before the account was paid up. To give citizens an incentive to take the trouble to\\napprehend beggars and deliver them to the workhouse, Bentham proposed a reward of twenty shillings\\nper apprehension—to be added, of course, to the beggar’s tab.\\n6\\nBentham also applied utilitarian logic to rooming assignments within the facility, to minimize the\\ndiscomfort inmates suffered from their neighbors: “Next to every class, from which any inconvenience is\\nto be apprehended, station a class unsusceptible of that inconvenience.” So, for example, “next to\\nraving lunatics, or persons of profligate conversation, place the deaf and dumb . . . Next to prostitutes\\nand loose women, place the aged women.” As for “the shockingly deformed,” Bentham proposed housing\\nthem alongside inmates who were blind.\\n7\\nHarsh though his proposal may seem, Bentham’s aim was not punitive. \\nIt was meant simply to\\npromote the general welfare by solving a problem that diminished social utility. His scheme for pauper\\nmanagement was never adopted. But the utilitarian spirit that informed it is alive and well today. Before\\nconsidering some present-day instances of utilitarian thinking, it is worth asking whether Bentham’s\\nphilosophy is objectionable, and if so, on what grounds.\\nObjection 1: Individual Rights\\nThe most glaring weakness of utilitarianism, many argue, is that it fails to respect individual rights. By\\ncaring only about the sum of satisfactions, it can run roughshod over individual people. For the\\nutilitarian, individuals matter, but only in the sense that each person’s preferences should be counted\\nalong with everyone else’s. But this means that the utilitarian logic, if consistently applied, could\\nsanction ways of treating persons that violate what we think of as fundamental norms of decency and\\nrespect, as the following cases illustrate:\\nThrowing Christians to lions\\nIn ancient Rome, they threw Christians to the lions in the Coliseum for the amusement of the crowd.\\nImagine how the utilitarian calculus would go: Yes, the Christian suffers excruciating pain as the lion\\nmauls and devours him. But think of the collective ecstasy of the cheering spectators packing the\\nColiseum. If enough Romans derive enough pleasure from the violent spectacle, are there any grounds\\non which a utilitarian can condemn it?\\nThe utilitarian may worry that such games will coarsen habits and breed more violence in the streetsof Rome; or lead to fear and trembling among prospective victims that they, too, might one day be\\ntossed to the lions. If these effects are bad enough, they could conceivably outweigh the pleasure the\\ngames provide, and give the utilitarian a \\nreason to ban them. But if these calculations are the only\\nreasons to desist from subjecting Christians to violent death for the sake of entertainment, isn’t\\nsomething of moral importance missing?\\nIs torture ever justified?\\nA similar question arises in contemporary debates about whether torture is ever justified in the\\ninterrogation of suspected terrorists. Consider the ticking time bomb scenario: Imagine that you are the\\nhead of the local CIA branch. You capture a terrorist suspect who you believe has information about a\\nnuclear device set to go off in Manhattan later the same day. In fact, you have reason to suspect that\\nhe planted the bomb himself. As the clock ticks down, he refuses to admit to being a terrorist or to\\ndivulge the bomb’s location. Would it be right to torture him until he tells you where the bomb is and how\\nto disarm it?\\nThe argument for doing so begins with a utilitarian calculation. Torture inflicts pain on the suspect,\\ngreatly reducing his happiness or utility. But thousands of innocent lives will be lost if the bomb\\nexplodes. So you might argue, on utilitarian grounds, that it’s morally justified to inflict intense pain on\\none person if doing so will prevent death and suffering on a massive scale. Former Vice President\\nRichard Cheney’s argument that the use of harsh interrogation techniques against suspected Al-Qaeda\\nterrorists helped avert another terrorist attack on the United States rests on this utilitarian logic.\\nThis is not to say that utilitarians necessarily favor torture. Some utilitarians oppose torture on\\npractical grounds. They argue that it seldom works, since information extracted under duress is often\\nunreliable. So pain is inflicted, but the community is not made any safer: there is no increase in the\\ncollective utility. Or they worry that if our country engages in torture, our soldiers will face harsher\\ntreatment if taken prisoner. This result could actually reduce the overall utility associated with our use of\\ntorture, all things considered.\\nThese practical considerations may or may not be true. As reasons to oppose torture, however, they\\nare entirely compatible with utilitarian thinking. They do not assert that torturing a human being is\\nintrinsically wrong, only that practicing torture will have bad effects that, taken as a whole, will do more\\nharm than good.\\nSome people reject torture on principle. They believe that it violates human rights and fails to respect\\nthe intrinsic dignity of human beings. Their case against torture does not depend on utilitarian\\nconsiderations. They argue that human rights and human dignity have a moral basis that lies beyond\\nutility. If they are right, then Bentham’s philosophy is wrong.\\nOn the face of it, the ticking time bomb scenario seems to support Bentham’s side of the argument.\\nNumbers do seem to make a moral difference. It is one thing to accept the possible death of three men\\nin a lifeboat to avoid killing one innocent cabin boy in cold blood. But what if thousands of innocent lives\\nare at stake, as in the ticking time bomb scenario? What if hundreds of thousands of lives were at risk?\\nThe utilitarian would argue that, at a certain point, even the most ardent advocate of human rights would\\nhave a hard time insisting it is morally preferable to let vast numbers of innocent people die than to\\ntorture a single terrorist suspect who may know where the bomb is hidden.\\nAs a test of utilitarian moral reasoning, however, the ticking time bomb case is misleading. It purports\\nto prove that numbers count, so that if enough lives are at stake, we should be willing to override our\\nscruples about dignity and rights. And if that is true, then morality is about calculating costs and benefits\\nafter all.\\nBut the torture scenario does not show that the prospect of saving many lives justifies inflicting\\nsevere pain on one innocent person. Recall that the person being tortured to save all those lives is a\\nsuspected terrorist, in fact the person we believe may have planted the bomb. The moral force of the\\ncase for torturing him depends heavily on the assumption that he is in some way responsible for\\ncreating the danger we \\nnow seek to avert. Or if he is not responsible for this bomb, we assume he has\\ncommitted other terrible acts that make him deserving of harsh treatment. The moral intuitions at work in\\nthe ticking time bomb case are not only about costs and benefits, but also about the non-utilitarian idea\\nthat terrorists are bad people who deserve to be punished.We can see this more clearly if we alter the scenario to remove any element of presumed guilt.\\nSuppose the only way to induce the terrorist suspect to talk is to torture his young daughter (who has no\\nknowledge of her father’s nefarious activities). Would it be morally permissible to do so? I suspect that\\neven a hardened utilitarian would flinch at the notion. But this version of the torture scenario offers a\\ntruer test of the utilitarian principle. It sets aside the intuition that the terrorist deserves to be punished\\nanyhow (regardless of the valuable information we hope to extract), and forces us to assess the\\nutilitarian calculus on its own.\\nThe city of happiness\\nThe second version of the torture case (the one involving the innocent daughter) brings to mind a short\\nstory by Ursula K. Le Guin. The story (“The Ones Who Walked Away from Omelas”) tells of a city called\\nOmelas—a city of happiness and civic celebration, a place without kings or slaves, without\\nadvertisements or a stock exchange, a place without the atomic bomb. Lest we find this place too\\nunrealistic to imagine, the author tells us one more thing about it: “In a basement under one of the\\nbeautiful public buildings of Omelas, or perhaps in the cellar of one of its spacious private homes, there\\nis a room. It has one locked door, and no window.” And in this room sits a child. The child is feeble-\\nminded, malnourished, and neglected. It lives out its days in wretched misery.\\nThey all know it is there, all the people of Omelas . . . They all know that it has to be there . . .\\n[T]hey all understand that their happiness, the beauty of their city, the tenderness of their\\nfriendships, the health \\nof their children, . . . even the abundance of their harvest and the kindly\\nweathers of their skies, depend wholly on this child’s abominable misery. . . . If the child were\\nbrought up into the sunlight out of the vile place, if it were cleaned and fed and comforted, that\\nwould be a good thing, indeed; but if it were done, in that day and hour all the prosperity and\\nbeauty and delight of Omelas would wither and be destroyed. Those are the terms.\\n8\\nAre those terms morally acceptable? The first objection to Bentham’s utilitarianism, the one that\\nappeals to fundamental human rights, says they are not—even if they lead to a city of happiness. It\\nwould be wrong to violate the rights of the innocent child, even for the sake of the happiness of the\\nmultitude.\\nObjection 2: A Common Currency of Value\\nUtilitarianism claims to offer a science of morality, based on measuring, aggregating, and calculating\\nhappiness. It weighs preferences without judging them. Everyone’s preferences count equally. This\\nnonjudgmental spirit is the source of much of its appeal. And its promise to make moral choice a science\\ninforms much contemporary economic reasoning. But in order to aggregate preferences, it is necessary\\nto measure them on a single scale. Bentham’s idea of utility offers one such common currency.\\nBut is it possible to translate all moral goods into a single currency of value without losing something\\nin the translation? The second objection to utilitarianism doubts that it is. According to this objection, all\\nvalues can’t be captured by a common currency of value.\\nTo explore this objection, consider the way utilitarian logic is applied in cost-benefit analysis, a form of\\ndecision-making that is widely used by governments and corporations. Cost-benefit analysis tries to\\nbring rationality and rigor to complex social choices by translating all costs and benefits into monetary\\nterms—and then comparing them.\\nThe benefits of lung cancer\\nPhilip Morris, the tobacco company, does big business in the Czech Republic, where cigarette smoking\\nremains popular and socially acceptable. Worried about the rising health care costs of smoking, the\\nCzech government recently considered raising taxes on cigarettes. In hopes of fending off the taxincrease, Philip Morris commissioned a cost-benefit analysis of the effects of smoking on the Czech\\nnational budget. The study found that the government actually gains more money than it loses from\\nsmoking. The reason: although smokers impose higher medical costs on the budget while they are alive,\\nthey die early, and so save the government considerable sums in health care, pensions, and housing for\\nthe elderly. According to the study, once the “positive effects” of smoking are taken into account—\\nincluding cigarette tax revenues and savings due to the premature deaths of smokers—the net gain to\\nthe treasury is $147 million per year.\\n9\\nThe cost-benefit analysis proved to be a public relations disaster for Philip Morris. “Tobacco\\ncompanies used to deny that cigarettes killed people,” one commentator wrote. “Now they brag about\\nit.”\\n10\\n An anti-smoking group ran newspaper ads showing the foot of a cadaver in a morgue with a\\n$1,227 price tag attached to the toe, representing the savings to the Czech government of each\\nsmoking-related death. Faced with public outrage and ridicule, the chief executive of Philip Morris\\napologized, saying the study showed “a complete and unacceptable disregard of basic human values.”\\n11\\nSome would say the Philip Morris smoking study illustrates the moral folly of cost-benefit analysis and\\nthe utilitarian way of thinking that underlies it. Viewing lung cancer deaths as a boon for the bottom line\\ndoes display a callous disregard for human life. Any morally defensible policy toward smoking would\\nhave to consider not only the fiscal effects but also the consequences for public health and human well-\\nbeing.\\nBut a utilitarian would not dispute the relevance of these broader consequences—the pain and\\nsuffering, the grieving families, the loss of \\nlife. Bentham invented the concept of utility precisely to\\ncapture, on a single scale, the disparate range of things we care about, including the value of human\\nlife. For a Benthamite, the smoking study does not embarrass utilitarian principles but simply misapplies\\nthem. A fuller cost-benefit analysis would add to the moral calculus an amount representing the cost of\\ndying early for the smoker and his family, and would weigh these against the savings the smoker’s early\\ndeath would provide the government.\\nThis takes us back to the question of whether all values can be translated into monetary terms. Some\\nversions of cost-benefit analysis try to do so, even to the point of placing a dollar value on human life.\\nConsider two uses of cost-benefit analysis that generated moral outrage, not because they didn’t\\ncalculate the value of human life, but because they did.\\nExploding gas tanks\\nDuring the 1970s, the Ford Pinto was one of the best-selling subcompact cars in the United States.\\nUnfortunately, its fuel tank was prone to explode when another car collided with it from the rear. More\\nthan five hundred people died when their Pintos burst into flames, and many more suffered severe burn\\ninjuries. When one of the burn victims sued Ford Motor Company for the faulty design, it emerged that\\nFord engineers had been aware of the danger posed by the gas tank. But company executives had\\nconducted a cost-benefit analysis and determined that the benefits of fixing it (in lives saved and injuries\\nprevented) were not worth the eleven dollars per car it would have cost to equip each car with a device\\nthat would have made the gas tank safer.\\nTo calculate the benefits to be gained by a safer gas tank, Ford estimated that 180 deaths and 180\\nburn injuries would result if no changes were made. It then placed a monetary value on each life lost and\\ninjury suffered—$200,000 per life, and $67,000 per injury. It added to these amounts the number and\\nvalue of the Pintos likely to go up in flames, \\nand calculated that the overall benefit of the safety\\nimprovement would be $49.5 million. But the cost of adding an $11 device to 12.5 million vehicles would\\nbe $137.5 million. So the company concluded that the cost of fixing the fuel tank was not worth the\\nbenefits of a safer car.\\n12\\nUpon learning of the study, the jury was outraged. It awarded the plaintiff $2.5 million in compensatory\\ndamages and $125 million in punitive damages (an amount later reduced to $3.5 million).\\n13\\n Perhaps the\\njurors considered it wrong for a corporation to assign a monetary value to human life, or perhaps they\\nthought that $200,000 was egregiously low. Ford had not come up with that figure on its own, but had\\ntaken it from a U.S. government agency. In the early 1970s, the National Highway Traffic Safety\\nAdministration had calculated the cost of a traffic fatality. Counting future productivity losses, medicalcosts, funeral costs, and the victim’s pain and suffering, the agency arrived at $200,000 per fatality.\\nIf the jury’s objection was to the price tag, not the principle, a utilitarian could agree. Few people\\nwould choose to die in a car crash for $200,000. Most people like living. To measure the full effect on\\nutility of a traffic fatality, one would have to include the victim’s loss of future happiness, not only lost\\nearnings and funeral costs. What, then, would be a truer estimate of the dollar value of a human life?\\nA discount for seniors\\nWhen the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency tried to answer this question, it, too, prompted moral\\noutrage, but of a different kind. In 2003, the EPA presented a cost-benefit analysis of new air pollution\\nstandards. The agency assigned a more generous value to human life than did Ford, but with an age-\\nadjusted twist: $3.7 million per life saved due to cleaner air, except for those older than seventy, whose\\nlives were valued at $2.3 million. Lying behind the different valuations was a utilitarian notion: saving an\\nolder person’s life produces less utility \\nthan saving a younger person’s life. (The young person has\\nlonger to live, and therefore more happiness still to enjoy.) Advocates for the elderly did not see it that\\nway. They protested the “senior citizen discount,” and argued that government should not assign greater\\nvalue to the lives of the young than of the old. Stung by the protest, the EPA quickly renounced the\\ndiscount and withdrew the report.\\n14\\nCritics of utilitarianism point to such episodes as evidence that cost-benefit analysis is misguided,\\nand that placing a monetary value on human life is morally obtuse. Defenders of cost-benefit analysis\\ndisagree. They argue that many social choices implicitly trade off some number of lives for other goods\\nand conveniences. Human life has its price, they insist, whether we admit it or not.\\nFor example, the use of the automobile exacts a predictable toll in human lives—more than forty\\nthousands deaths annually in the United States. But that does not lead us as a society to give up cars.\\nIn fact, it does not even lead us to lower the speed limit. During an oil crisis in 1974, the U.S. Congress\\nmandated a national speed limit of fifty-five miles per hour. Although the goal was to save energy, an\\neffect of the lower speed limit was fewer traffic fatalities.\\nIn the 1980s, Congress removed the restriction, and most states raised the speed limit to sixty-five\\nmiles per hour. Drivers saved time, but traffic deaths increased. At the time, no one did a cost-benefit\\nanalysis to determine whether the benefits of faster driving were worth the cost in lives. But some years\\nlater, two economists did the math. They defined one benefit of a higher speed limit as a quicker\\ncommute to and from work, calculated the economic benefit of the time saved (valued at an average\\nwage of $20 an hour) and divided the savings by the number of additional deaths. They discovered that,\\nfor the convenience of driving faster, Americans were effectively valuing human life at the rate of $1.54\\nmillion per life. That was the economic gain, per fatality, of driving ten miles an hour faster.\\n15\\nAdvocates of cost-benefit analysis point out that by driving sixty-five \\nmiles an hour rather than fifty-\\nfive, we implicitly value human life at $1.54 million—much less than the $6 million per life figure typically\\nused by U.S. government agencies in setting pollution standards and health-and-safety regulations. So\\nwhy not be explicit about it? If trading off certain levels of safety for certain benefits and conveniences\\nis unavoidable, they argue, we should do so with our eyes open, and should compare the costs and\\nbenefits as systematically as possible—even if that means putting a price tag on human life.\\nUtilitarians see our tendency to recoil at placing a monetary value on human life as an impulse we\\nshould overcome, a taboo that obstructs clear thinking and rational social choice. For critics of\\nutilitarianism, however, our hesitation points to something of moral importance—the idea that it is not\\npossible to measure and compare all values and goods on a single scale.\\nPain for pay\\nIt is not obvious how this dispute can be resolved. But some empirically minded social scientists have\\ntried. In the 1930s, Edward Thorndike, a social psychologist, tried to prove what utilitarianism assumes:\\nnamely, that it is possible to translate our seemingly disparate desires and aversions into a common\\ncurrency of pleasure and pain. He conducted a survey of young recipients of government relief, asking\\nthem how much they would have to be paid to suffer various experiences. For example: “How muchwould you have to be paid to have one upper front tooth pulled out?” Or “to have the little toe of one foot\\ncut off?” Or “to eat a live earthworm six inches long?” Or “to choke a stray cat to death with your bare\\nhands?” Or “to live all the rest of your life on a farm in Kansas, ten miles from any town?”\\n16\\nWhich of these items do you think commanded the highest price, and which the least? Here is the\\nprice list his survey produced (in 1937 dollars):\\n \\nTooth\\n$4,500\\nToe\\n$57,000\\nWorm\\n$100,000\\nCat\\n$10,000\\nKansas\\n$300,000\\n \\nThorndike thought his findings lent support to the idea that all goods can be measured and compared\\non a single scale. “Any want or satisfaction which exists at all, exists in some amount and is therefore\\nmeasurable,” he wrote. “The life of a dog or a cat or a chicken . . . consists largely of and is determined\\nby appetites, cravings, desires and their gratification. . . . So also does the life of man, though the\\nappetites and desires are more numerous, subtle, and complicated.”\\n17\\nBut the preposterous character of Thorndike’s price list suggests the absurdity of such comparisons.\\nCan we really conclude that the respondents considered the prospect of life on a farm in Kansas to be\\nthree times as disagreeable as eating an earthworm, or do these experiences differ in ways that don’t\\nadmit meaningful comparison? Thorndike conceded that up to one-third of the respondents stated that\\nno sum would induce them to suffer some of these experiences, suggesting that they considered them\\n“immeasurably repugnant.”\\n18\\nSt. Anne’s girls\\nThere may be no knock-down argument for or against the claim that all moral goods can be translated\\nwithout loss into a single measure of value. But here is a further case that calls the claim into question:\\nIn the 1970s, when I was a graduate student at Oxford, there were separate colleges for men and\\nwomen. The women’s colleges had parietal rules against male guests staying overnight in women’s\\nrooms. These rules were rarely enforced and easily violated, or so I was told. Most college officials no\\nlonger saw it as their role to enforce traditional \\nnotions of sexual morality. Pressure grew to relax these\\nrules, which became a subject of debate at St. Anne’s College, one of the all-women colleges.\\nSome older women on the faculty were traditionalists. They opposed allowing male guests, on\\nconventional moral grounds; it was immoral, they thought, for unmarried young women to spend the night\\nwith men. But times had changed, and the traditionalists were embarrassed to give the real grounds for\\ntheir objection. So they translated their arguments into utilitarian terms. “If men stay overnight,” they\\nargued, “the costs to the college will increase.” How, you might wonder? “Well, they’ll want to take\\nbaths, and that will use more hot water.” Furthermore, they argued, “we will have to replace the\\nmattresses more often.”\\nThe reformers met the traditionalists’ arguments by adopting the following compromise: Each woman\\ncould have a maximum of three overnight guests each week, provided each guest paid fifty pence per\\nnight to defray the costs to the college. The next day, the headline in the \\nGuardian\\n read, “St. Anne’s\\nGirls, Fifty Pence a Night.” The language of virtue had not translated very well into the language of\\nutility. Soon thereafter, the parietal rules were waived altogether, and so was the fee.\\nJohn Stuart Mill\\nWe have considered two objections to Bentham’s “greatest happiness” principle—that it does not giveadequate weight to human dignity and individual rights, and that it wrongly reduces everything of moral\\nimportance to a single scale of pleasure and pain. How compelling are these objections?\\nJohn Stuart Mill (1806–1873) believed they could be answered. A generation after Bentham, he tried\\nto save utilitarianism by recasting it as a more humane, less calculating doctrine. Mill was the son of\\nJames Mill, a friend and disciple of Bentham. James Mill home-schooled his \\nson, and the young Mill\\nbecame a child prodigy. He studied Greek at the age of three and Latin at eight. At age eleven, he wrote\\na history of Roman law. When he was twenty, he suffered a nervous breakdown, which left him\\ndepressed for several years. Shortly thereafter he met Harriet Taylor. She was a married woman at the\\ntime, with two children, but she and Mill became close friends. When her husband died twenty years\\nlater, she and Mill married. Mill credited Taylor as his greatest intellectual companion and collaborator as\\nhe set about revising Bentham’s doctrine.\\nThe case for liberty\\nMill’s writings can be read as a strenuous attempt to reconcile individual rights with the utilitarian\\nphilosophy he inherited from his father and adopted from Bentham. His book \\nOn Liberty\\n (1859) is the\\nclassic defense of individual freedom in the English-speaking world. Its central principle is that people\\nshould be free to do whatever they want, provided they do no harm to others. Government may not\\ninterfere with individual liberty in order to protect a person from himself, or to impose the majority’s\\nbeliefs about how best to live. The only actions for which a person is accountable to society, Mill\\nargues, are those that affect others. As long as I am not harming anyone else, my “independence is, of\\nright, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.”\\n19\\nThis unyielding account of individual rights would seem to require something stronger than utility as its\\njustification. For consider: Suppose a large majority despises a small religion and wants it banned. Isn’t\\nit possible, even likely, that banning the religion will produce the greatest happiness for the greatest\\nnumber? True, the banned minority would suffer unhappiness and frustration. But if the majority is big\\nenough and passionate enough in its hatred of the heretics, its collective happiness could well outweigh\\ntheir suffering. If that scenario is possible, then it appears that utility is a shaky, unreliable foundation for\\nreligious liberty. Mill’s principle of liberty would seem to need a sturdier moral basis than Bentham’s\\nprinciple of utility.\\nMill disagrees. He insists that the case for individual liberty rests entirely on utilitarian considerations:\\n“It is proper to state that I forego any advantage which could be derived to my argument from the idea of\\nabstract right, as a thing independent of utility. I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical\\nquestions; but it must be utility in the largest sense, grounded on the permanent interests of man as a\\nprogressive being.”\\n20\\nMill thinks we should maximize utility, not case by case, but in the long run. And over time, he argues,\\nrespecting individual liberty will lead to the greatest human happiness. Allowing the majority to silence\\ndissenters or censor free-thinkers might maximize utility today, but it will make society worse off—less\\nhappy—in the long run.\\nWhy should we assume that upholding individual liberty and the right to dissent will promote the\\nwelfare of society in the long run? Mill offers several reasons: The dissenting view may turn out to be\\ntrue, or partially true, and so offer a corrective to prevailing opinion. And even if it is not, subjecting\\nprevailing opinion to a vigorous contest of ideas will prevent it from hardening into dogma and prejudice.\\nFinally, a society that forces its members to embrace custom and convention is likely to fall into a\\nstultifying conformity, depriving itself of the energy and vitality that prompt social improvement.\\nMill’s speculations about the salutary social effects of liberty are plausible enough. But they do not\\nprovide a convincing moral basis for individual rights, for at least two reasons: First, respecting\\nindividual rights for the sake of promoting social progress leaves rights hostage to contingency.\\nSuppose we encounter a society that achieves a kind of long-term happiness by despotic means.\\nWouldn’t the utilitarian have to conclude that, in such a society, individual rights are not morally\\nrequired? Second, basing rights on utilitarian considerations misses the sense in which violating\\nsomeone’s rights inflicts a wrong on the individual, whatever its effect on the general welfare. If the\\nmajority persecutes \\nadherents of an unpopular faith, doesn’t it do an injustice \\nto them\\n, as individuals,\\nregardless of any bad effects such intolerance may produce for society as a whole over time?Mill has an answer to these challenges, but it carries him beyond the confines of utilitarian morality.\\nForcing a person to live according to custom or convention or prevailing opinion is wrong, Mill explains,\\nbecause it prevents him from achieving the highest end of human life—the full and free development of\\nhis human faculties. Conformity, in Mill’s account, is the enemy of the best way to live.\\nThe human faculties of perception, judgment, discriminative feeling, mental activity, and even\\nmoral preference, are exercised only in making a choice. He who does anything because it is\\nthe custom, makes no choice. He gains no practice either in discerning or in desiring what is\\nbest. The mental and moral, like the muscular powers, are improved only by being used . . . He\\nwho lets the world, or his own portion of it, choose his plan of life for him, has no need of any\\nother faculty than the ape-like one of imitation. He who chooses his plan for himself, employs\\nall his faculties.\\n21\\nMill concedes that following convention may lead a person to a satisfying life path and keep him out of\\nharm’s way. “But what will be his comparative worth as a human being?” he asks. “It really is of\\nimportance, not only what men do, but also what manner of men they are that do it.”\\n22\\nSo actions and consequences are not all that matter after all. Character also counts. For Mill,\\nindividuality matters less for the pleasure it brings than for the character it reflects. “One whose desires\\nand impulses are not his own, has no character, no more than a steam engine has character.”\\n23\\nMill’s robust celebration of individuality is the most distinctive contribution of \\nOn Liberty\\n. But it is also\\na kind of heresy. Since it appeals to moral ideals beyond utility—ideals of character and human\\nflourishing—it is not really an elaboration of Bentham’s principle but a renunciation of it, despite Mill’s\\nclaim to the contrary.\\nHigher pleasures\\nMill’s response to the second objection to utilitarianism—that it reduces all values to a single scale—\\nalso turns out to lean on moral ideals independent of utility. In \\nUtilitarianism\\n (1861), a long essay Mill\\nwrote shortly after \\nOn Liberty\\n, he tries to show that utilitarians can distinguish higher pleasures from\\nlower ones.\\nFor Bentham, pleasure is pleasure and pain is pain. The only basis for judging one experience better\\nor worse than another is the intensity and duration of the pleasure or pain it produces. The so-called\\nhigher pleasures or nobler virtues are simply those that produce stronger, longer pleasure. Bentham\\nrecognizes no qualitative distinction among pleasures. “The quantity of pleasure being equal,” he writes,\\n“push-pin is as good as poetry.”\\n24\\n (Push-pin was a children’s game.)\\nPart of the appeal of Bentham’s utilitarianism is this nonjudgmental spirit. It takes people’s\\npreferences as they are, without passing judgment on their moral worth. All preferences count equally.\\nBentham thinks it is presumptuous to judge some pleasures as inherently better than others. Some\\npeople like Mozart, others Madonna. Some like ballet, others like bowling. Some read Plato, others\\nPenthouse\\n. Who is to say, Bentham might ask, which pleasures are higher, or worthier, or nobler than\\nothers?\\nThe refusal to distinguish higher from lower pleasures is connected to Bentham’s belief that all values\\ncan be measured and compared on a single scale. If experiences differ only in the quantity of pleasure\\nor pain they produce, not qualitatively, then it makes sense to weigh them on a single scale. But some\\nobject to utilitarianism on precisely this point: they believe that some pleasures really are “higher” than\\nothers. If some pleasures are worthy and others base, they say, why should society weigh all\\npreferences equally, much less regard the sum of such preferences as the greatest good?\\nThink again about the Romans throwing Christians to the lions in the Coliseum. One objection to the\\nbloody spectacle is that it violates the rights of the victims. But a further objection is that it caters to\\nperverse pleasures rather than noble ones. Wouldn’t it be better to change those preferences than to\\nsatisfy them?\\nIt is said that the Puritans banned bearbaiting, not because of the pain it caused the bears but\\nbecause of the pleasure it gave the onlookers. Bearbaiting is no longer a popular pastime, butdogfighting and cock-fighting hold a persistent allure, and some jurisdictions ban them. One justification\\nfor such bans is to prevent cruelty to animals. But such laws may also reflect a moral judgment that\\nderiving pleasure from dogfights is abhorrent, something a civilized society should discourage. You don’t\\nneed to be a Puritan to have some sympathy with this judgment.\\nBentham would count all preferences, regardless of their worth, in determining what the law should be.\\nBut if more people would rather watch dogfights than view Rembrandt paintings, should society\\nsubsidize dogfight arenas rather than art museums? If certain pleasures are base and degrading, why\\nshould they have any weight at all in deciding what laws should be adopted?\\nMill tries to save utilitarianism from this objection. Unlike Bentham, Mill believes it is possible to\\ndistinguish between higher and lower pleasures—to assess the quality, not just the quantity or intensity,\\nof our desires. And he thinks he can make this distinction without relying on any moral ideas other than\\nutility itself.\\nMill begins by pledging allegiance to the utilitarian creed: “Actions are right in proportion as they tend\\nto promote happiness; wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is\\nintended pleasure and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain and the privation of pleasure.” He also\\naffirms the “theory of life on which this theory of morality is grounded—namely, that pleasure and\\nfreedom from pain are the only things desirable as ends; and that all desirable things . . . are desirable\\neither for pleasure inherent in themselves or as means to the promotion of pleasure and the prevention\\nof pain.”\\n25\\nDespite insisting that pleasure and pain are all that matter, Mill acknowledges that “some kinds of\\npleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others.” How can we know which pleasures are\\nqualitatively higher? Mill proposes a simple test: “Of two pleasures, if there be one to which all or almost\\nall who have experience of both give a decided preference, irrespective of any feeling of moral\\nobligation to prefer it, that is the more desirable pleasure.”\\n26\\nThis test has one clear advantage: It does not depart from the utilitarian idea that morality rests wholly\\nand simply on our actual desires. “[T]he sole evidence it is possible to produce that anything is desirable\\nis that people actually desire it,” Mill writes.\\n27\\n But as a way of arriving at qualitative distinctions among\\npleasures, his test seems open to an obvious objection: Isn’t it often the case that we prefer lower\\npleasures to higher ones? Don’t we sometimes prefer lying on the sofa watching sitcoms to reading\\nPlato or going to the opera? And isn’t it possible to prefer these undemanding experiences without\\nconsidering them to be particularly worthwhile?\\nShakespeare versus\\n The Simpsons\\nWhen I discuss Mill’s account of higher pleasures with my students, I try out a version of his test. I show\\nthe students three examples of popular entertainment: a World Wrestling Entertainment fight (a raucous\\nspectacle in which the so-called wrestlers attack one another with folding chairs); a \\nHamlet\\n soliloquy\\nperformed by a Shakespearean actor; and an excerpt from \\nThe Simpsons\\n. I then ask two questions:\\nWhich of these performances did you enjoy most—find most pleasurable—and which do you think is the\\nhighest, or worthiest?\\nInvariably \\nThe Simpsons\\n gets the most votes as most enjoyable, followed by Shakespeare. (A few\\nbrave souls confess their fondness for the WWE.) But when asked which experience they consider\\nqualitatively highest, the students vote overwhelmingly for Shakespeare.\\nThe results of this experiment pose a challenge to Mill’s test. Many students prefer watching Homer\\nSimpson, but still think a \\nHamlet\\n soliloquy offers a higher pleasure. Admittedly, some may say\\nShakespeare is better because they are sitting in a classroom and don’t want to seem philistine. And\\nsome students argue that \\nThe Simpsons\\n, with its subtle mix of irony, humor, and social commentary,\\ndoes rival Shakespeare’s art. But if most people who have experienced both prefer watching \\nThe\\nSimpsons\\n, then Mill would be hard pressed to conclude that Shakespeare is qualitatively higher.\\nAnd yet Mill does not want to give up the idea that some ways of life are nobler than others, even if\\nthe people who live them are less easily satisfied. “A being of higher faculties requires more to make\\nhim happy, is capable probably of more acute suffering . . . than one of an inferior type; but in spite of\\nthese liabilities, he can never really wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence.”Why are we unwilling to trade a life that engages our higher faculties for a life of base contentment? Mill\\nthinks the reason has something to do with “the love of liberty and personal independence,” and\\nconcludes that “its most appropriate appellation is a sense of dignity, which all human beings possess in\\none form or other.”\\n28\\nMill concedes that “occasionally, under the influence of temptation,” even the best of us postpone\\nhigher pleasures to lower ones. Everyone gives in to the impulse to be a couch potato once in a while.\\nBut this does not mean we don’t know the difference between Rembrandt and reruns. Mill makes this\\npoint in a memorable passage: “It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better\\nto be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is\\nbecause they only know their own side of the question.”\\n29\\nThis expression of faith in the appeal of the higher human faculties is compelling. But in relying on it,\\nMill strays from the utilitarian premise. No longer are de facto desires the sole basis for judging what is\\nnoble and what is base. Now the standard derives from an ideal of human dignity independent of our\\nwants and desires. The higher pleasures are not higher \\nbecause\\n we prefer them; we prefer them\\nbecause we recognize them as higher. We judge \\nHamlet\\n as great art not because we like it more than\\nlesser entertainments, but because it engages our highest faculties and makes us more fully human.\\nAs with individual rights, so with higher pleasures: Mill saves utilitarianism from the charge that it\\nreduces everything to a crude calculus of pleasure and pain, but only by invoking a moral ideal of human\\ndignity and personality independent of utility itself.\\n \\nOf the two great proponents of utilitarianism, Mill was the more humane philosopher, Bentham the more\\nconsistent one. Bentham died in 1832, at the age of eighty-four. But if you go to London, you can visit\\nhim today. He provided in his will that his body be preserved, embalmed, and displayed. And so he can\\nbe found at University College London, where he sits pensively in a glass case, dressed in his actual\\nclothing.\\nShortly before he died, Bentham asked himself a question consistent with his philosophy: Of what use\\ncould a dead man be to the living? One use, he concluded, would be to make one’s corpse available for\\nthe study of anatomy. In the case of great philosophers, however, better yet to preserve one’s physical\\npresence in order to inspire future generations of thinkers.\\n30\\n Bentham put himself in this second\\ncategory.\\nIn fact, modesty was not one of Bentham’s obvious character traits. Not only did he provide strict\\ninstructions for his body’s preservation and display, he also suggested that his friends and disciples\\nmeet every year “for the purpose of commemorating the founder of the greatest happiness system of\\nmorals and legislation,” and that when they did, they should bring Bentham out for the occasion.\\n31\\nHis admirers have obliged. Bentham’s “auto icon,” as he dubbed it, was on hand for the founding of\\nthe International Bentham Society in the 1980s. And the stuffed Bentham is reportedly wheeled in for\\nmeetings of the governing council of the college, whose minutes record him as “present but not\\nvoting.”\\n32\\nDespite Bentham’s careful planning, the embalming of his head went badly, so he now keeps his vigil\\nwith a wax head in place of the real one. His actual head, now kept in a cellar, was displayed for a time\\non a plate between his feet. But students stole the head and ransomed it back to the college for a\\ncharitable donation.\\n33\\nEven in death, Jeremy Bentham promotes the greatest good for the greatest number.3. DO WE OWN OURSELVES? / LIBERTARIANISM\\nEach fall,\\n \\nForbes\\n magazine publishes a list of the four hundred richest Americans. For over a decade,\\nMicrosoft founder Bill Gates III has topped the list, as he did in 2008, when \\nForbes\\n estimated his net\\nworth at $57 billion. Other members of the club include investor Warren Buffett (ranked 2nd, with $50\\nbillion), the owners of Wal-Mart, the founders of Google and Amazon, assorted oilmen, hedge fund\\nmanagers, media moguls, and real-estate tycoons, television talk show host Oprah Winfrey (in 155th\\nplace, with $2.7 billion), and New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner (tied for last place, with\\n$1.3 billion).\\n1\\nSo vast is the wealth at the top of the American economy, even in a weakened state, that being a\\nmere billionaire is barely enough to gain admission to the Forbes 400. In fact, the richest 1 percent of\\nAmericans possess over a third of the country’s wealth, more than the combined wealth of the bottom\\n90 percent\\n of American families. The top 10 percent of American households take in 42 percent of all\\nincome and hold 71 percent of all wealth.\\n2\\nEconomic inequality is steeper in the United States than in other democracies. Some people think that\\nsuch inequality is unjust, and favor taxing the rich to help the poor. Others disagree. They say there \\nis\\nnothing unfair about economic inequality, provided it arises without force or fraud, through the choices\\npeople make in a market economy.\\nWho is right? If you think justice means maximizing happiness, you might favor wealth redistribution,\\non the following grounds: Suppose we take $1 million from Bill Gates and disperse it among a hundred\\nneedy recipients, giving each of them $10,000. Overall happiness would likely increase. Gates would\\nscarcely miss the money, while each of the recipients would derive great happiness from the $10,000\\nwindfall. Their collective utility would go up more than his would go down.\\nThis utilitarian logic could be extended to support quite a radical redistribution of wealth; it would tell us\\nto transfer money from the rich to the poor until the last dollar we take from Gates hurts him as much as\\nit helps the recipient.\\nThis Robin Hood scenario is open to at least two objections—one from within utilitarian thinking, the\\nother from outside it. The first objection worries that high tax rates, especially on income, reduce the\\nincentive to work and invest, leading to a decline in productivity. If the economic pie shrinks, leaving\\nless to redistribute, the overall level of utility might go down. So before taxing Bill Gates and Oprah\\nWinfrey too heavily, the utilitarian would have to ask whether doing so would lead them to work less and\\nso to earn less, eventually reducing the amount of money available for redistribution to the needy.\\nThe second objection regards these calculations as beside the point. It argues that taxing the rich to\\nhelp the poor is unjust because it violates a fundamental right. According to this objection, taking money\\nfrom Gates and Winfrey without their consent, even for a good cause, is coercive. It violates their\\nliberty to do with their money whatever they please. Those who object to redistribution on these grounds\\nare often called “libertarians.”\\nLibertarians favor unfettered markets and oppose government regulation, not in the name of economic\\nefficiency but in the name of human freedom. Their central claim is that each of us has a fundamental\\nright to liberty—the right to do whatever we want with the things we own, provided we respect other\\npeople’s rights to do the same.\\nThe Minimal State\\nIf the libertarian theory of rights is correct, then many activities of the modern state are illegitimate, and\\nviolations of liberty. Only a minimal state—one that enforces contracts, protects private property from\\ntheft, and keeps the peace—is compatible with the libertarian theory of rights. Any state that does more\\nthan this is morally unjustified.\\nThe libertarian rejects three types of policies and laws that modern states commonly enact:\\n1. No Paternalism. Libertarians oppose laws to protect people from harming themselves. Seatbelt\\nlaws are a good example; so are motorcycle helmet laws. Even if riding a motorcycle without a helmet isreckless, and even if helmet laws save lives and prevent devastating injuries, libertarians argue that\\nsuch laws violate the right of the individual to decide what risks to assume. As long as no third parties\\nare harmed, and as long as motorcycle riders are responsible for their own medical bills, the state has\\nno right to dictate what risks they may take with their bodies and lives.\\n2. No Morals Legislation. Libertarians oppose using the coercive force of law to promote notions of\\nvirtue or to express the moral convictions of the majority. Prostitution may be morally objectionable to\\nmany people, but that does not justify laws that prevent consenting adults from engaging in it. Majorities\\nin some communities may disapprove of homosexuality, but that does not justify laws that deprive gay\\nmen and lesbians of the right to choose their sexual partners for themselves.\\n3. No Redistribution of Income or Wealth. The libertarian theory of rights rules out any law that\\nrequires some people to help others, including taxation for redistribution of wealth. Desirable though it\\nmay be for the affluent to support the less fortunate—by subsidizing \\ntheir health care or housing or\\neducation—such help should be left up to the individual to undertake, not mandated by the government.\\nAccording to the libertarian, redistributive taxes are a form of coercion, even theft. The state has no\\nmore right to force affluent taxpayers to support social programs for the poor than a benevolent thief has\\nthe right to steal money from a rich person and give it to the homeless.\\nThe libertarian philosophy does not map neatly onto the political spectrum. Conservatives who favor\\nlaissez-faire economic policies often part company with libertarians on cultural issues such as school\\nprayer, abortion, and restrictions on pornography. And many proponents of the welfare state hold\\nlibertarian views on issues such as gay rights, reproductive rights, freedom of speech, and the\\nseparation of church and state.\\nDuring the 1980s, libertarian ideas found prominent expression in the pro-market, antigovernment\\nrhetoric of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. As an intellectual doctrine, libertarianism emerged\\nearlier, in opposition to the welfare state. In \\nThe Constitution of Liberty\\n (1960), the Austrian-born\\neconomist-philosopher Friedrich A. Hayek (1899–1992) argued that any attempt to bring about greater\\neconomic equality was bound to be coercive and destructive of a free society.\\n3\\n In \\nCapitalism and\\nFreedom\\n (1962), the American economist Milton Friedman (1912–2006) argued that many widely\\naccepted state activities are illegitimate infringements on individual freedom. Social Security, or any\\nmandatory, government-run retirement program, is one of his prime examples: “If a man knowingly\\nprefers to live for today, to use his resources for current enjoyment, deliberately choosing a penurious\\nold age, by what right do we prevent him from doing so?” Friedman asks. We might urge such a person\\nto save for his retirement, “but are we entitled to use coercion to prevent him from doing what he\\nchooses to do?”\\n4\\nFriedman objects to minimum wage laws on similar grounds. Government has no right to prevent\\nemployers from paying any wage, however low, that workers are prepared to accept. The government\\nalso violates individual freedom when it makes laws against employment discrimination. If employers\\nwant to discriminate on the basis of race, religion, or any other factor, the state has no right to prevent\\nthem from doing so. In Friedman’s view, “such legislation clearly involves interference with the freedom\\nof individuals to enter into voluntary contracts with one another.”\\n5\\nOccupational licensing requirements also wrongly interfere with freedom of choice. If an untrained\\nbarber wants to offer his less-than-expert services to the public, and if some customers are willing to\\ntake their chances on a cheap haircut, the state has no business forbidding the transaction. Friedman\\nextends this logic even to physicians. If I want a bargain appendectomy, I should be free to hire anyone\\nI choose, certified or not, to do the job. While it is true that most people want assurance of their doctor’s\\ncompetence, the market can provide such information. Instead of relying on state licensing of doctors,\\nFriedman suggests, patients can use private rating services such as \\nConsumer Reports\\n or the \\nGood\\nHousekeeping\\n seal of approval.\\n6\\nFree-Market Philosophy\\nIn \\nAnarchy, State and Utopia\\n (1974), Robert Nozick offers a philosophical defense of libertarian\\nprinciples and a challenge to familiar ideas of distributive justice. He begins with the claim that\\nindividuals have rights “so strong and far-reaching” that “they raise the question of what, if anything, thestate may do.” He concludes that “only a minimal state, limited to enforcing contracts and protecting\\npeople against force, theft, and fraud, is justified. Any more extensive state violates persons’ rights not\\nto be forced to do certain things, and is unjustified.”\\n7\\nProminent among the things that no one should be forced to do is help other people. Taxing the rich to\\nhelp the poor coerces the rich. It violates their right to do what they want with the things they own.\\nAccording to Nozick, there is nothing wrong with economic inequality as such. Simply knowing that the\\nForbes 400 have billions \\nwhile others are penniless doesn’t enable you to conclude anything about the\\njustice or injustice of the arrangement. Nozick rejects the idea that a just distribution consists of a\\ncertain pattern—such as equal income, or equal utility, or equal provision of basic needs. What matters\\nis how the distribution came about.\\nNozick rejects patterned theories of justice in favor of those that honor the choices people make in\\nfree markets. He argues that distributive justice depends on two requirements—justice in initial holdings\\nand justice in transfer.\\n8\\nThe first asks if the resources you used to make your money were legitimately yours in the first place.\\n(If you made a fortune selling stolen goods, you would not be entitled to the proceeds.) The second asks\\nif you made your money either through free exchanges in the marketplace or from gifts voluntarily\\nbestowed upon you by others. If the answer to both questions is yes, you are entitled to what you have,\\nand the state may not take it without your consent. Provided no one starts out with ill-gotten gains, any\\ndistribution that results from a free market is just, however equal or unequal it turns out to be.\\nNozick concedes that it is not easy to determine whether the initial holdings that gave rise to today’s\\neconomic positions were themselves just or ill-gotten. How can we know to what extent today’s\\ndistribution of income and wealth reflects illegitimate seizures of land or other assets through force,\\ntheft, or fraud generations ago? If it can be shown that those who have landed on top are the\\nbeneficiaries of past injustices—such as the enslavement of African Americans or the expropriation of\\nNative Americans—then, according to Nozick, a case can be made for remedying the injustice through\\ntaxation, reparations, or other means. But it is important to notice that these measures are for the sake\\nof redressing past wrongs, not for the sake of bringing about greater equality for its own sake.\\nNozick illustrates the folly (as he sees it) of redistribution with a hypothetical example about the\\nbasketball great Wilt Chamberlain, whose salary in the early 1970s reached the then lofty sum of\\n$200,000 \\nper season. Since Michael Jordan is the iconic basketball star of recent times, we can update\\nNozick’s example with Jordan, who in his last year with the Chicago Bulls was paid $31 million—more\\nper game than Chamberlain made in a season.\\nMichael Jordan’s Money\\nTo set aside any question about initial holdings, let’s imagine, Nozick suggests, that you set the initial\\ndistribution of income and wealth according to whatever pattern you consider just—a perfectly equal\\ndistribution, if you like. Now the basketball season begins. Those who want to see Michael Jordan play\\ndeposit five dollars in a box each time they buy a ticket. The proceeds in the box go to Jordan. (In real\\nlife, of course, Jordan’s salary is paid by the owners, from team revenues. Nozick’s simplifying\\nassumption—that the fans pay Jordan directly—is a way of focusing on the philosophical point about\\nvoluntary exchange.)\\nSince many people are eager to see Jordan play, attendance is high and the box becomes full. By the\\nend of the season, Jordan has $31 million, far more than anyone else. As a result, the initial distribution\\n—the one you consider just—no longer obtains. Jordan has more and others less. But the new\\ndistribution arose through wholly voluntary choices. Who has grounds for complaint? Not those who paid\\nto see Jordan play; they freely chose to buy tickets. Not those who dislike basketball and stayed at\\nhome; they didn’t spend a penny on Jordan, and are no worse off than before. Surely not Jordan; he\\nchose to play basketball in exchange for a handsome income.\\n9\\nNozick believes this scenario illustrates two problems with patterned theories of distributive justice.\\nFirst, liberty upsets patterns. Anyone who believes that economic inequality is unjust will have to\\nintervene in the free market, repeatedly and continuously, to undo the effects of the choices people\\nmake. Second, intervening in this way—taxing Jordan to support programs that help the disadvantaged—not \\nonly overturns the results of voluntary transactions; it also violates Jordan’s rights by taking his\\nearnings. It forces him, in effect, to make a charitable contribution against his will.\\nWhat exactly is wrong with taxing Jordan’s earnings? According to Nozick, the moral stakes go\\nbeyond money. At issue, he believes, is nothing less than human freedom. He reasons as follows:\\n“Taxation of earnings from labor is on a par with forced labor.”\\n10\\n If the state has the right to claim some\\nportion of my earnings, it also has the right to claim some portion of my time. Instead of taking, say, 30\\npercent of my income, it might just as well direct me to spend 30 percent of my time working for the\\nstate. But if the state can force me to labor on its behalf, it essentially asserts a property right in me.\\nSeizing the results of someone’s labor is equivalent to seizing hours from him and directing him\\nto carry on various activities. If people force you to do certain work, or unrewarded work, for a\\ncertain period of time, they decide what you are to do and what purposes your work is to serve\\napart from your decisions. This . . . makes them a part-owner of you; it gives them a property\\nright in you.\\n11\\nThis line of reasoning takes us to the moral crux of the libertarian claim—the idea of self-ownership. If\\nI own myself, I must own my labor. (If someone else could order me to work, that person would be my\\nmaster, and I would be a slave.) But if I own my labor, I must be entitled to the fruits of my labor. (If\\nsomeone else were entitled to my earnings, that person would own my labor and would therefore own\\nme.) That is why, according to Nozick, taxing some of Michael Jordan’s $31 million to help the poor\\nviolates his rights. It asserts, in effect, that the state, or the community, is a part owner of him.\\nThe libertarian sees a moral continuity from taxation (taking my earnings) to forced labor (taking my\\nlabor) to slavery (denying that I own myself):\\n \\nSelf-Ownership\\nTaking\\nperson\\nslavery\\nlabor\\nforced labor\\nfruits of labor\\ntaxation\\n \\nOf course, even the most steeply progressive income tax does not claim 100 percent of anyone’s\\nincome. So the government does not claim to own its taxpaying citizens entirely. But Nozick maintains\\nthat it does claim to own part of us—whatever part corresponds to the portion of income we must pay to\\nsupport causes beyond the minimal state.\\nDo We Own Ourselves?\\nWhen, in 1993, Michael Jordan announced his retirement from basketball, Chicago Bulls fans were\\nbereft. He would later come out of retirement and lead the Bulls to three more championships. But\\nsuppose that, in 1993, the Chicago City Council, or, for that matter, Congress, sought to ease the\\ndistress of Chicago Bulls fans by voting to require Jordan to play basketball for one-third of the next\\nseason. Most people would consider such a law unjust, a violation of Jordan’s liberty. But if Congress\\nmay not force Jordan to return to the basketball court (for even a third of the season), by what right\\ndoes it force him to give up one-third of the money he makes playing basketball?\\nThose who favor the redistribution of income through taxation offer various objections to the\\nlibertarian logic. Most of these objections can be answered.\\nObjection 1: Taxation is not as bad as forced labor\\n.\\nIf you are taxed, you can always choose to work less and pay lower taxes; but if you are forced to\\nlabor, you have no such choice.\\nLibertarian reply\\n: Well, yes. But why should the state force you to \\nmake that choice? Some people\\nlike watching sunsets, while others prefer activities that cost money—going to the movies, eating out,\\nsailing on yachts, and so on. Why should people who prefer leisure be taxed less than those who preferactivities that cost money?\\nConsider an analogy: A thief breaks into your home, and has time to take either your $1,000 flat-\\nscreen television or the $1,000 in cash you have hidden in your mattress. You might hope he steals the\\ntelevision, because you could then choose whether or not to spend $1,000 to replace it. If the thief stole\\nthe cash, he would leave you no such choice (assuming it’s too late to return the television for a full\\nrefund). But this preference for losing the television (or working less) is beside the point; the thief (and\\nthe state) do wrong in both cases, whatever adjustments the victims might make to mitigate their losses.\\nObjection 2: The poor need the money more\\n.\\nLibertarian reply\\n: Maybe so. But this is a reason to persuade the affluent to support the needy through\\ntheir own free choice. It does not justify forcing Jordan and Gates to give to charity. Stealing from the\\nrich and giving to the poor is still stealing, whether it’s done by Robin Hood or the state.\\nConsider this analogy: Just because a patient on dialysis \\nneeds\\n one of my kidneys more than I do\\n(assuming I have two healthy ones) doesn’t mean he has a right to it. Nor may the state lay claim to one\\nof my kidneys to help the dialysis patient, however urgent and pressing his needs may be. Why not?\\nBecause it’s mine. Needs don’t trump my fundamental right to do what I want with the things I own.\\nObjection 3: Michael Jordan doesn’t play alone. He therefore owes a debt to those who\\ncontribute to his success\\n.\\nLibertarian reply\\n: It’s true that Jordan’s success depends on other people. Basketball is a team sport.\\nPeople would not have paid $31 million to \\nwatch him shoot free-throws by himself on an empty court. He\\ncould never have made all that money without teammates, coaches, trainers, referees, broadcasters,\\nstadium maintenance workers, and so on.\\nBut these people have already been paid the market value of their services. Although they make less\\nthan Jordan, they voluntarily accepted compensation for the jobs they perform. So there is no reason to\\nsuppose that Jordan owes them a portion of his earnings. And even if Jordan owes something to his\\nteammates and coaches, it is hard to see how this debt justifies taxing his earnings to provide food\\nstamps for the hungry or public housing for the homeless.\\nObjection 4: Jordan is not really being taxed without his consent. As a citizen of a democracy,\\nhe has a voice in making the tax laws to which he is subject\\n.\\nLibertarian reply\\n: Democratic consent is not enough. Suppose Jordan voted against the tax law, but it\\npassed anyway. Wouldn’t the IRS still insist that he pay? It certainly would. You might argue that by\\nliving in this society, Jordan gives his consent (at least implicitly) to abide by the majority’s will and obey\\nthe laws. But does this mean that simply by living here as citizens, we write the majority a blank check,\\nand consent in advance to all laws, however unjust?\\nIf so, the majority may tax the minority, even confiscate its wealth and property, against its will. What\\nthen becomes of individual rights? If democratic consent justifies the taking of property, does it also\\njustify the taking of liberty? May the majority deprive me of freedom of speech and of religion, claiming\\nthat, as a democratic citizen, I have already given my consent to whatever it decides?\\nThe libertarian has a ready response to each of the first four objections. But a further objection is less\\neasy to dismiss:\\nObjection 5: Jordan is lucky\\n.\\nHe is fortunate to possess the talent to excel at basketball, and lucky to live in a society that prizes the\\nability to soar through the air and put a ball through a hoop. No matter how hard he has worked to\\ndevelop his skills, Jordan cannot claim credit for his natural gifts, or for living at a time when basketball\\nis popular and richly rewarded. These things are not his doing. So it cannot be said that he is morallyentitled to keep all the money his talents reap. The community does him no injustice by taxing his\\nearnings for the public good.\\n \\nLibertarian reply\\n: This objection questions whether Jordan’s talents are really his. But this line of\\nargument is potentially dangerous. If Jordan is not entitled to the benefits that result from the exercise of\\nhis talents, then he doesn’t really own them. And if he doesn’t own his talents and skills, then he doesn’t\\nreally own himself. But if Jordan doesn’t own himself, who does? Are you sure you want to attribute to\\nthe political community a property right in its citizens?\\n \\nThe notion of self-ownership is appealing, especially for those who seek a strong foundation for\\nindividual rights. The idea that I belong to myself, not to the state or political community, is one way of\\nexplaining why it is wrong to sacrifice my rights for the welfare of others. Recall our reluctance to push\\nthe heavy man off the bridge to block a runaway trolley. Don’t we hesitate to push him because we\\nrecognize that his life belongs to him? Had the heavy man jumped to his death to save the workers on\\nthe track, few would object. It is, after all, his life. But his life is not for us to take and use, even for a\\ngood cause. The same can be said of the unfortunate cabin boy. Had Parker chosen to sacrifice his life\\nto save his starving shipmates, most people would say he had a right to do so. But his mates had no\\nright to help themselves to a life that did not belong to them.\\nMany who reject laissez-faire economics invoke the idea of self-ownership in other domains. This\\nmay explain the persisting appeal of libertarian ideas, even for people who are sympathetic to the\\nwelfare state. Consider the way self-ownership figures in arguments about reproductive freedom, sexual\\nmorality, and privacy rights. Government should not ban contraceptives or abortion, it is often said,\\nbecause women should be free to decide what to do with their own bodies. The law should not punish\\nadultery, prostitution, or homosexuality, many argue, because consenting adults should be free to\\nchoose their sexual partners for themselves. Some favor markets in kidneys for transplantation on the\\ngrounds that I own my own body, and should therefore be free to sell my body parts. Some extend this\\nprinciple to defend a right to assisted suicide. Since I own my own life, I should be free to end it if I wish,\\nand to enlist a willing physician (or anyone else) to assist. The state has no right to prevent me from\\nusing my body or disposing of my life as I please.\\nThe idea that we own ourselves figures in many arguments for freedom of choice. If I own my body,\\nmy life, and my person, I should be free to do whatever I want with them (provided I don’t harm others).\\nDespite the appeal of this idea, its full implications are not easy to embrace.\\nIf you are tempted by libertarian principles and want to see how far you would take them, consider\\nthese cases:\\nSelling kidneys\\nMost countries ban the buying and selling of organs for transplantation. In the United States, people may\\ndonate one of their kidneys but not sell it on the open market. But some people argue that such laws\\nshould be changed. They point out that thousands of people die each year waiting for kidney transplants\\n—and that the supply would be increased if there existed a free market for kidneys. They also argue that\\npeople in need of money should be free to sell their kidneys if they wish.\\nOne argument for permitting the buying and selling of kidneys rests on the libertarian notion of self-\\nownership: If I own my own body, I should be free to sell my body parts as I please. As Nozick writes,\\n“The central core of the notion of a property right in X . . . is the right to determine what shall be done\\nwith X.”\\n12\\n But few advocates of organ sales actually embrace the full libertarian logic.\\nHere’s why: Most proponents of markets in kidneys emphasize the moral importance of saving lives,\\nand the fact that most people who donate one of their kidneys can manage with the other one. But if you\\nbelieve that your body and life are your property, neither of these considerations really matters. If you\\nown yourself, your right to use your body as you please is reason enough to let you sell your body\\nparts. The lives you save or the good you do is beside the point.\\nTo see how this is so, imagine two atypical cases:\\nFirst, suppose the prospective buyer of your spare kidney is perfectly healthy. He is offering you (or\\nmore likely a peasant in the developing world) $8,000 for a kidney, not because he desperately needsan organ transplant but because he is an eccentric art dealer who sells human organs to affluent clients\\nas coffee table conversation pieces. Should people be allowed to buy and sell kidneys for this purpose?\\nIf you believe that we own ourselves, you would be hard pressed to say no. What matters is not the\\npurpose but the right to dispose of our property as we please. Of course, you might abhor the frivolous\\nuse of body parts and favor organ sales for life-saving purposes only. But if you held this view, your\\ndefense of the market would not rest on libertarian premises. You would concede that we do not have\\nan unlimited property right in our bodies.\\nConsider a second case. Suppose a subsistence farmer in an Indian village wants more than anything\\nelse in the world to send his child to college. To raise the money, he sells his spare kidney to an affluent\\nAmerican in need of a transplant. A few years later, as the farmer’s second child approaches college\\nage, another buyer comes to his village and offers a handsome price for his second kidney. Should he\\nbe free to sell that one, too, even if going without a kidney would kill him? If the moral case for organ\\nsales rests on the notion of self-ownership, the answer must be yes. It would be odd to think that the\\nfarmer owns one of his kidneys but not the other. Some might object that no one should be induced to\\ngive up his life for money. But if we own our bodies and lives, then the farmer has every right to sell his\\nsecond kidney, even if this amounts to selling his life. (The scenario is not wholly hypothetical. In the\\n1990s, a California prison inmate wanted to donate a second kidney to his daughter. The ethics board\\nof the hospital refused.)\\nIt is possible, of course, to permit only those organ sales that save lives and that do not imperil the\\nlife of the seller. But such a policy would not rest on the principle of self-ownership. If we truly own our\\nbodies and lives, it should be up to us to decide whether to sell our body parts, for what purposes, and\\nat what risk to ourselves.\\nAssisted suicide\\nIn 2007, Dr. Jack Kevorkian, age seventy-nine, emerged from a Michigan prison having served eight\\nyears for administering lethal drugs to terminally ill patients who wanted to die. As a condition of his\\nparole, he agreed not to assist any more patients in committing suicide. During the 1990s, Dr.\\nKevorkian (who became known as “Dr. Death”) campaigned for laws allowing assisted suicide and\\npracticed what he preached, helping 130 people end their lives. He was charged, tried, and convicted of\\nsecond-degree murder only after he gave the CBS television program \\n60 Minutes\\n a video that showed\\nhim in action, giving a lethal injection to a man suffering from Lou Gehrig’s disease.\\n13\\nAssisted suicide is illegal in Michigan, Dr. Kevorkian’s home state, and in every other state except\\nOregon and Washington. Many countries \\nprohibit assisted suicide, and only a few (most famously the\\nNetherlands) expressly permit it.\\nAt first glance, the argument for assisted suicide seems a textbook application of libertarian\\nphilosophy. For the libertarian, laws banning assisted suicide are unjust, for the following reason: If my\\nlife belongs to me, I should be free to give it up. And if I enter into a voluntary agreement with someone\\nto help me die, the state has no right to interfere.\\nBut the case for permitting assisted suicide does not necessarily depend on the idea that we own\\nourselves, or that our lives belong to us. Many who favor assisted suicide do not invoke property rights,\\nbut argue in the name of dignity and compassion. They say that terminally ill patients who are suffering\\ngreatly should be able to hasten their deaths, rather than linger in excruciating pain. Even those who\\nbelieve we have a general duty to preserve human life may conclude that, at a certain point, the claims\\nof compassion outweigh our duty to carry on.\\nWith terminally ill patients, the libertarian rationale for assisted suicide is hard to disentangle from the\\ncompassion rationale. To assess the moral force of the self-ownership idea, consider a case of\\nassisted suicide that does not involve a terminally ill patient. It is, admittedly, a weird case. But its\\nweirdness allows us to assess the libertarian logic on its own, unclouded by considerations of dignity\\nand compassion.\\nConsensual cannibalismIn 2001, a strange encounter took place in the German village of Rotenburg. Bernd-Jurgen Brandes, a\\nforty-three-year-old software engineer, responded to an Internet ad seeking someone willing to be killed\\nand eaten. The ad had been posted by Armin Meiwes, forty-two, a computer technician. Meiwes was\\noffering no monetary compensation, only the experience itself. Some two hundred people replied to the\\nad. Four traveled to Meiwes’s farmhouse for an interview, but decided they were not interested. But\\nwhen Brandes met with Meiwes \\nand considered his proposal over coffee, he gave his consent. Meiwes\\nproceeded to kill his guest, carve up the corpse, and store it in plastic bags in his freezer. By the time he\\nwas arrested, the “Cannibal of Rotenburg” had consumed over forty pounds of his willing victim, cooking\\nsome of him in olive oil and garlic.\\n14\\nWhen Meiwes was brought to trial, the lurid case fascinated the public and confounded the court.\\nGermany has no law against cannibalism. The perpetrator could not be convicted of murder, the defense\\nmaintained, because the victim was a willing participant in his own death. Meiwes’s lawyer argued that\\nhis client could be guilty only of “killing on request,” a form of assisted suicide that carries a maximum\\nfive-year sentence. The court attempted to resolve the conundrum by convicting Meiwes of\\nmanslaughter and sentencing him to eight and a half years in prison.\\n15\\n But two years later, an appeals\\ncourt overturned the conviction as too lenient, and sentenced Meiwes to life in prison.\\n16\\n In a bizarre\\ndenouement to the sordid tale, the cannibal killer has reportedly become a vegetarian in prison, on the\\ngrounds that factory farming is inhumane.\\n17\\nCannibalism between consenting adults poses the ultimate test for the libertarian principle of self-\\nownership and the idea of justice that follows from it. It is an extreme form of assisted suicide. Since it\\nhas nothing to do with relieving the pain of a terminally ill patient, it can be justified only on the grounds\\nthat we own our bodies and lives, and may do with them what we please. If the libertarian claim is right,\\nbanning consensual cannibalism is unjust, a violation of the right to liberty. The state may no more\\npunish Armin Meiwes than it may tax Bill Gates and Michael Jordan to help the poor.4. HIRED HELP / MARKETS AND MORALS\\nMany of our most heated debates\\n about justice involve the role of markets: Is the free market fair?\\nAre there some goods that money can’t buy—or shouldn’t? If so, what are these goods, and what’s\\nwrong with buying and selling them?\\nThe case for free markets typically rests on two claims—one about freedom, the other about welfare.\\nThe first is the libertarian case for markets. It says that letting people engage in voluntary exchanges\\nrespects their freedom; laws that interfere with the free market violate individual liberty. The second is\\nthe utilitarian argument for markets. It says that free markets promote the general welfare; when two\\npeople make a deal, both gain. As long as their deal makes them better off without hurting anyone else,\\nit must increase overall utility.\\nMarket skeptics question these claims. They argue that market choices are not always as free as\\nthey may seem. And they argue that certain goods and social practices are corrupted or degraded if\\nbought and sold for money.\\nIn this chapter, we’ll consider the morality of paying people to perform two very different kinds of work\\n—fighting wars and bearing children. Thinking through the rights and wrongs of markets in these\\ncontested cases will help us clarify the differences among leading theories of justice.\\nWhat’s Just—Drafting Soldiers or Hiring Them?\\nIn the early months of the U.S. Civil War, festive rallies and patriotic sentiment prompted tens of\\nthousands of men in the Northern states to volunteer for the Union army. But with the Union defeat at\\nBull Run, followed by the failure the following spring of General George B. McClellan’s drive to capture\\nRichmond, Northerners began to doubt that the conflict would end quickly. More troops had to be raised,\\nand in July 1862, Abraham Lincoln signed the Union’s first draft law. A Confederate draft was already in\\nplace.\\nConscription ran against the grain of the American individualist tradition, and the Union draft made a\\nstriking concession to that tradition: Anyone who was drafted and didn’t want to serve could hire\\nsomeone else to take his place.\\n1\\nDraftees seeking substitutes ran ads in newspapers, offering payments as high as $1,500, a\\nconsiderable sum at the time. The Confederacy’s draft law also allowed for paid substitutes, giving rise\\nto the slogan “rich man’s war and poor man’s fight,” a complaint that echoed in the North. In March\\n1863, Congress passed a new draft law that sought to address the complaint. Although it did not\\neliminate the right to hire a substitute, it provided that any draftee could pay the government a fee of\\n$300 instead of serving. Although the commutation fee represented close to a year’s wages for an\\nunskilled laborer, the provision sought to bring the price of exemption within reach of ordinary workers.\\nSome cities and counties subsidized the fee for their draftees. And insurance societies enabled\\nsubscribers to pay a monthly premium for a policy that would cover the fee in the event of conscription.\\n2\\nThough intended to offer exemption from service at a bargain rate, the commutation fee was politically\\nmore unpopular than substitution—perhaps because it seemed to put a price on human life (or the risk of\\ndeath) and to give that price government sanction. Newspaper headlines proclaimed, “Three Hundred\\nDollars or Your Life.” Anger over the draft and the $300 commutation fee prompted violence \\nagainst\\nenrollment officers, most notably in the New York City draft riots of July 1863, which lasted several days\\nand claimed more than a hundred lives. The following year, Congress enacted a new draft law that\\neliminated the commutation fee. The right to hire a substitute, however, was retained in the North\\n(though not in the South) throughout the war.\\n3\\nIn the end, relatively few draftees wound up fighting in the Union army. (Even after conscription was\\nestablished, the bulk of the army consisted of volunteers, prompted to enlist by bounty payments and the\\nthreat of being drafted.) Many whose numbers were drawn in draft lotteries either fled or were exempted\\nfor disability. Of the roughly 207,000 men who were actually drafted, 87,000 paid the commutation fee,74,000 hired substitutes, and only 46,000 served.\\n4\\n Those who hired substitutes to fight in their place\\nincluded Andrew Carnegie and J. P. Morgan, the fathers of Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt, and future\\npresidents Chester A. Arthur and Grover Cleveland.\\n5\\nWas the Civil War system a just way of allocating military service? When I put this question to my\\nstudents, almost all of them say no. They say it’s unfair to allow the affluent to hire substitutes to fight in\\ntheir place. Like many Americans who protested in the 1860s, they consider this system a form of class\\ndiscrimination.\\nI then ask the students whether they favor a draft or the all-volunteer army we have today. Almost all\\nfavor the volunteer army (as do most Americans). But this raises a hard question: If the Civil War\\nsystem was unfair because it let the affluent hire other people to fight their wars, doesn’t the same\\nobjection apply to the volunteer army?\\nThe method of hiring differs, of course. Andrew Carnegie had to find his own substitute and pay him\\ndirectly; today the military recruits the soldiers to fight in Iraq or Afghanistan, and we, the taxpayers,\\ncollectively pay them. But it remains the case that those of us who’d rather not enlist hire other people\\nto fight our wars and risk their lives. So what’s the difference, morally speaking? If the Civil War system\\nof hiring substitutes was unjust, isn’t the volunteer army unjust as well?\\nTo examine this question, let’s set aside the Civil War system and consider the two standard ways of\\nrecruiting soldiers—conscription and the market.\\nIn its simplest form, conscription fills the ranks of the military by requiring all eligible citizens to serve,\\nor, if not all are needed, by holding a lottery to determine who will be called. This was the system used\\nby the United States during the First and Second World Wars. A draft was also used during the Vietnam\\nWar, though the system was complex and riddled with deferments for students and people in certain\\noccupations, allowing many to avoid having to fight.\\nThe existence of the draft fueled opposition to the Vietnam War, especially on college campuses.\\nPartly in response, President Richard Nixon proposed doing away with conscription, and in 1973, as the\\nUnited States wound down its presence in Vietnam, the all-volunteer military force replaced the draft.\\nSince military service was no longer compulsory, the military increased pay and other benefits to attract\\nthe soldiers it needed.\\nA volunteer army, as we use the term today, fills its ranks through the use of the labor market—as do\\nrestaurants, banks, retail stores, and other businesses. The term volunteer is something of a misnomer.\\nThe volunteer army is not like a volunteer fire department, in which people serve without pay, or the\\nlocal soup kitchen, where volunteer workers donate their time. It is a professional army in which soldiers\\nwork for pay. The soldiers are “volunteers” only in the sense that paid employees in any profession are\\nvolunteers. No one is conscripted, and the job is performed by those who agree to do so in exchange\\nfor money and other benefits.\\nThe debate over how a democratic society should fill the ranks of the military is at its most intense\\nduring times of war, as the Civil War draft riots and Vietnam-era protests attest. After the United States\\nadopted an all-volunteer force, the question of justice in the allocation of military service faded from\\npublic attention. But the U.S.-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have revived public discussion about\\nwhether it is \\nright for a democratic society to recruit its soldiers by means of the market.\\nMost Americans favor the volunteer army, and few want to go back to conscription. (In September\\n2007, in the midst of the Iraq War, a Gallup poll found that Americans opposed reinstating the draft by\\n80 to 18 percent.\\n6\\n) But the renewed debate over the volunteer army and the draft brings us face-to-face\\nwith some big questions of political philosophy—questions about individual liberty and civic obligation.\\nTo explore these questions, let’s compare the three ways of allocating military service we have\\nconsidered—conscription, conscription with a provision for hiring substitutes (the Civil War system), and\\nthe market system. Which is most just?\\n \\n1. conscription\\n2. conscription allowing paid substitutes (Civil War system)\\n3. market system (volunteer army)\\nThe Case for the Volunteer ArmyIf you are a libertarian, the answer is obvious. Conscription (policy 1) is unjust because it is coercive, a\\nform of slavery. It implies that the state owns its citizens and can do with them what it pleases, including\\nforcing them to fight and risk their lives in war. Ron Paul, a Republican member of Congress and a\\nleading libertarian, recently made this claim in opposing calls to reinstate the draft to fight the Iraq War:\\n“Conscription is slavery, plain and simple. And it was made illegal under the 13th amendment, which\\nprohibits involuntary servitude. One may well be killed as a military draftee, which makes conscription a\\nvery dangerous kind of enslavement.”\\n7\\nBut even if you don’t consider conscription equivalent to slavery, you might oppose it on the grounds\\nthat it limits people’s choices, and therefore reduces overall happiness. This is a utilitarian argument\\nagainst conscription. It holds that, compared to a system that permits \\nthe hiring of substitutes,\\nconscription reduces people’s welfare by preventing mutually advantageous trades. If Andrew Carnegie\\nand his substitute both want to make a deal, why prevent them from doing so? The freedom to enter into\\nthe exchange seems to increase each party’s utility without reducing anyone else’s. Therefore, for\\nutilitarian reasons, the Civil War system (policy 2) is better than pure conscription (policy 1).\\nIt’s easy to see how utilitarian assumptions can support market reasoning. If you assume that a\\nvoluntary exchange makes both parties better off, without harming anyone else, you have a good\\nutilitarian case for letting markets rule.\\nWe can see this if we now compare the Civil War system (policy 2) with the volunteer army (policy 3).\\nThe same logic that argues for letting draftees hire substitutes also argues for a full-market solution: If\\nyou’re going to let people hire substitutes, why draft anyone in the first place? Why not simply recruit\\ntroops through the labor market? Set whatever wage and benefits are necessary to attract the number\\nand quality of soldiers required, and let people choose for themselves whether to take the job. No one is\\nforced to serve against his or her will, and those willing to serve can decide if military service is\\npreferable, all things considered, to their other alternatives.\\nSo, from a utilitarian point of view, the volunteer army seems the best of the three options. Letting\\npeople freely choose to enlist based on the compensation being offered enables them to serve only if\\ndoing so maximizes their own utility; and those who don’t want to serve don’t suffer the utility loss of\\nbeing forced into the military against their will.\\nA utilitarian could conceivably object that the volunteer army is more expensive than a conscript army.\\nTo attract the requisite number and quality of soldiers, pay and benefits must be higher than when\\nsoldiers are forced to serve. So a utilitarian might worry that the increased happiness of better-paid\\nsoldiers would be offset by the unhappiness of taxpayers who now pay more for military service.\\nBut this objection is not very convincing, especially if the alternative \\nis conscription (with or without\\nsubstitution). It would be odd to insist, on utilitarian grounds, that the cost to taxpayers of other\\ngovernment services, such as police and fire protection, should be reduced by forcing randomly chosen\\npeople to perform these tasks at below-market pay; or that the cost of highway maintenance should be\\nreduced by requiring a subset of taxpayers chosen by lottery either to perform the work themselves or\\nhire others to do so. The unhappiness that would result from such coercive measures would probably\\noutweigh the benefit to the taxpayers of cheaper government services.\\nSo, from the standpoint of both libertarian and utilitarian reasoning, the volunteer army seems best,\\nthe Civil War hybrid system second best, and conscription the least desirable way of allocating military\\nservice. But at least two objections can be made to this line of argument. One objection is about\\nfairness and freedom; the other is about civic virtue and the common good.\\nObjection 1: Fairness and freedom\\nThe first objection holds that, for those with limited alternatives, the free market is not all that free.\\nConsider an extreme case: A homeless person sleeping under a bridge may have chosen, in some\\nsense, to do so; but we would not necessarily consider his choice to be a free one. Nor would we be\\njustified in assuming that he must prefer sleeping under a bridge to sleeping in an apartment. In order to\\nknow whether his choice reflects a preference for sleeping out of doors or an inability to afford an\\napartment, we need to know something about his circumstances. Is he doing this freely or out of\\nnecessity?\\nThe same question can be asked of market choices generally—including the choices people makeThe same question can be asked of market choices generally—including the choices people make\\nwhen they take on various jobs. How does this apply to military service? We can’t determine the justice\\nor injustice of the volunteer army without knowing more about the background conditions that prevail in\\nthe society: Is there a reasonable degree of equal opportunity, or do some people have very few\\noptions in \\nlife? Does everyone have a chance to get a college education, or is it the case that, for some\\npeople, the only way to afford college is to enlist in the military?\\nFrom the standpoint of market reasoning, the volunteer army is attractive because it avoids the\\ncoercion of conscription. It makes military service a matter of consent. But some people who wind up\\nserving in the all-volunteer army may be as averse to military service as those who stay away. If\\npoverty and economic disadvantage are widespread, the choice to enlist may simply reflect the lack of\\nalternatives.\\nAccording to this objection, the volunteer army may not be as voluntary as it seems. In fact, it may\\ninvolve an element of coercion. If some in the society have no other good options, those who choose to\\nenlist may be conscripted, in effect, by economic necessity. In that case, the difference between\\nconscription and the volunteer army is not that one is compulsory while the other is free; it’s rather that\\neach employs a different form of compulsion—the force of law in the first case and the pressure of\\neconomic necessity in the second. Only if people have a reasonable range of decent job options can it\\nbe said that the choice to serve for pay reflects their preferences rather than their limited alternatives.\\nThe class composition of today’s volunteer army bears out this objection, at least to some extent.\\nYoung people from low- to middle-income neighborhoods (median household income of $30,850 to\\n$57,836) are disproportionately represented in the ranks of active-duty army recruits.\\n8\\n Least\\nrepresented are the poorest 10 percent of the population (many of whom may lack the requisite\\neducation and skills) and the most affluent 20 percent (those from neighborhoods with median household\\nincomes of $66,329 and above).\\n9\\n In recent years, over 25 percent of army recruits have lacked a\\nregular high school diploma.\\n10\\n And while 46 percent of the civilian population has had some college\\neducation, only 6.5 percent of the 18-to-24-year-olds in the military’s enlisted ranks have ever been to\\ncollege.\\n11\\nIn recent years, the most privileged young people in American society have not opted for military\\nservice. The title of a recent book \\nabout the class composition of the armed forces captures this well:\\nAWOL: The Unexcused Absence of America’s Upper Classes from Military Service\\n.\\n12\\n Of the 750\\nmembers of Princeton’s class of 1956, the majority—450 students —joined the military after graduation.\\nOf the 1,108 members of Princeton’s class of 2006, only 9 students enlisted.\\n13\\n A similar pattern is\\nfound at other elite universities—and in the nation’s capital. Only 2 percent of members of Congress\\nhave a son or daughter serving in the military.\\n14\\nCongressman Charles Rangel, a Democrat from Harlem who is a decorated Korean War veteran,\\nconsiders this unfair, and has called for reinstatement of the draft. “As long as Americans are being\\nshipped off to war,” he wrote, “then everyone should be vulnerable, not just those who, because of\\neconomic circumstances, are attracted by lucrative enlistment bonuses and educational incentives.” He\\npoints out that, in New York City, “the disproportionate burden of service is dramatic. In 2004, 70% of\\nthe volunteers in the city were black or Hispanic, recruited from lower income communities.”\\n15\\nRangel opposed the Iraq War, and believes it never would have been launched if the children of\\npolicy-makers had had to share the burden of fighting it. He also argues that, given the unequal\\nopportunities in American society, allocating military service by the market is unfair to those with the\\nfewest alternatives:\\nThe great majority of people bearing arms for this country in Iraq are from the poorer\\ncommunities in our inner cities and rural areas, places where enlistment bonuses of up to\\n$40,000 and thousands in educational benefits are very attractive. For people who have\\ncollege as an option, those incentives—at the risk to one’s life—don’t mean a thing.\\n16\\nSo the first objection to the market rationale for a volunteer army is concerned with unfairness and\\ncoercion—the unfairness of class discrimination and the coercion that can occur if economic\\ndisadvantage \\ncompels young people to risk their lives in exchange for a college education and other\\nbenefits.Notice that the coercion objection is not an objection to the volunteer army as such. It only applies to\\na volunteer army that operates in a society with substantial inequalities. Alleviate those inequalities, and\\nyou remove the objection. Imagine, for example, a perfectly equal society, in which everyone had\\naccess to the same educational opportunities. In such a society, no one could complain that the choice\\nto enlist in the military was less than free, because unfairly pressured by economic necessity.\\nOf course, no society is perfectly equal. So the risk of coercion always hovers over the choices\\npeople make in the labor market. How much equality is needed to ensure that market choices are free\\nrather than coerced? At what point do inequalities in the background conditions of society undermine the\\nfairness of social institutions (such as the volunteer army) based on individual choice? Under what\\nconditions is the free market really free? To answer these questions, we’ll need to examine moral and\\npolitical philosophies that see freedom—not utility—at the heart of justice. So let’s postpone these\\nquestions until we turn to Immanuel Kant and John Rawls in later chapters.\\nObjection 2: Civic virtue and the common good\\nIn the meantime, let’s consider a second objection to the use of markets in allocating military service—\\nthe objection in the name of civic virtue and the common good.\\nThis objection says that military service is not just another job; it’s a civic obligation. According to this\\nargument, all citizens have a duty to serve their country. Some proponents of this view believe this\\nobligation can be discharged only through military service, while others say it can be fulfilled through\\nother forms of national service, such as the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, or Teach for America. But if\\nmilitary \\nservice (or national service) is a civic duty, it’s wrong to put it up for sale on the market.\\nConsider another civic responsibility—jury duty. No one dies performing jury duty, but being called to\\nserve on a jury can be onerous, especially if it conflicts with work or other pressing commitments. And\\nyet we don’t let people hire substitutes to take their place on juries. Nor do we use the labor market to\\ncreate a paid, professional, “all-volunteer” jury system. Why not? From the standpoint of market\\nreasoning, a case could be made for doing so. The same utilitarian arguments raised against drafting\\nsoldiers can be made against drafting jurors: Allowing a busy person to get out of jury duty by hiring a\\nsubstitute would make both parties better off. Doing away with mandatory jury duty would be better still;\\nletting the labor market recruit the requisite number of qualified jurors would enable those who want the\\nwork to have it and those who dislike the work to avoid it.\\nSo why do we forego the increased social utility of a market for jurors? Perhaps because we worry\\nthat paid jurors would come disproportionately from disadvantaged backgrounds, and that the quality of\\njustice would suffer. But there’s no reason to assume that the affluent make better jurors than those\\nfrom modest backgrounds. In any case, the wages and benefits could always be adjusted (as the army\\nhas done) to attract those with the necessary education and skills.\\nThe reason we draft jurors rather than hire them is that we regard the activity of dispensing justice in\\nthe courts as a responsibility all citizens should share. Jurors don’t simply vote; they deliberate with one\\nanother about the evidence and the law. And the deliberations draw on the disparate life experiences\\nthat jurors from various walks of life bring with them. Jury duty is not only a way of resolving cases. It is\\nalso a form of civic education, and an expression of democratic citizenship. Although jury duty is not\\nalways edifying, the idea that all citizens are obligated to perform it preserves a connection between the\\ncourts and the people.\\nSomething similar could be said of military service. The civic argument for conscription claims that\\nmilitary service, like jury duty, is a civic responsibility; it expresses, and deepens, democratic\\ncitizenship. From this point of view, turning military service into a commodity—a task we hire other\\npeople to perform—corrupts the civic ideals that should govern it. According to this objection, hiring\\nsoldiers to fight our wars is wrong, not because it’s unfair to the poor but because it allows us to\\nabdicate a civic duty.\\nThe historian David M. Kennedy has offered a version of this argument. He argues that “the U.S.\\narmed forces today have many of the attributes of a mercenary army,” by which he means a paid,\\nprofessional army that is separated to a significant degree from the society on whose behalf it fights.\\n17\\nHe doesn’t mean to disparage the motives of those who enlist. His worry is that hiring a relatively small\\nnumber of our fellow citizens to fight our wars lets the rest of us off the hook. It severs the link betweenthe majority of democratic citizens and the soldiers who fight in their name.\\nKennedy observes that, “proportionate to the population, today’s active-duty military establishment is\\nabout 4 percent of the size of the force that won World War II.” This makes it relatively easy for policy-\\nmakers to commit the country to war without having to secure the broad and deep consent of the\\nsociety as a whole. “History’s most powerful military force can now be sent into battle in the name of a\\nsociety that scarcely breaks a sweat when it does so.”\\n18\\n The volunteer army absolves most Americans\\nof the responsibility to fight and die for their country. While some see this as an advantage, this\\nexemption from shared sacrifice comes at the price of eroding political accountability:\\nA hugely preponderant majority of Americans with no risk whatsoever of exposure to military\\nservice have, in effect, hired some of the least advantaged of their fellow countrymen to do\\nsome of their most dangerous business while the majority goes on with their own affairs\\nunbloodied and undistracted.\\n19\\nOne of the most famous statements of the civic case for conscription was offered by Jean-Jacques\\nRousseau (1712–1778), the Geneva-born Enlightenment political theorist. In \\nThe Social Contract\\n(1762), he argues that turning a civic duty into a marketable good does not increase freedom, but rather\\nundermines it:\\nAs soon as public service ceases to be the chief business of the citizens, and they would\\nrather serve with their money than with their persons, the state is not far from its fall. When it is\\nnecessary to march out to war, they pay troops and stay at home. . . . In a country that is truly\\nfree, the citizens do everything with their own arms and nothing by means of money; so far\\nfrom paying to be exempted from their duties, they would even pay for the privilege of fulfilling\\nthem themselves. I am far from taking the common view: I hold enforced labor to be less\\nopposed to liberty than taxes.\\n20\\nRousseau’s robust notion of citizenship, and his wary view of markets, may seem distant from the\\nassumptions of our day. We are inclined to view the state, with its binding laws and regulations, as the\\nrealm of force; and to see the market, with its voluntary exchanges, as the realm of freedom. Rousseau\\nwould say this has things backward—at least where civic goods are concerned.\\nMarket advocates might defend the volunteer army by rejecting Rousseau’s strenuous notion of\\ncitizenship, or by denying its relevance to military service. But the civic ideals he invoked retain a\\ncertain resonance, even in a market-driven society such as the United States. Most supporters of the\\nvolunteer army vehemently deny that it amounts to a mercenary army. They rightly point out that many\\nof those who serve are motivated by patriotism, not only by the pay and benefits. But why do we\\nconsider this important? Provided the soldiers do their jobs well, why should we care about their\\nmotivation? Even as we relegate recruitment to the market, we find it hard to detach military service\\nfrom older notions of patriotism and civic virtue.\\nFor, consider: What, really, is the difference between the contemporary volunteer army and an army\\nof mercenaries? Both pay soldiers to fight. Both entice people to enlist by the promise of salary and\\nother benefits. If the market is an appropriate way of raising an army, what exactly is wrong with\\nmercenaries?\\nOne might reply that mercenaries are foreign nationals who fight only for pay, whereas the American\\nvolunteer army hires only Americans. But if the labor market is an appropriate way of raising troops, it’s\\nnot clear why the U.S. military should discriminate in hiring on the basis of nationality. Why shouldn’t it\\nactively recruit soldiers from among citizens of other countries who want the work and possess the\\nrelevant qualifications? Why not create a foreign legion of soldiers from the developing world, where\\nwages are low and good jobs are scarce?\\nIt is sometimes argued that foreign soldiers would be less loyal than Americans. But national origin is\\nno guarantee of loyalty on the battlefield, and military recruiters could screen foreign applicants to\\ndetermine their reliability. Once you accept the notion that the army should use the labor market to fill its\\nranks, there is no reason in principle to restrict eligibility to American citizens—no reason, that is, unless\\nyou believe military service is a civic responsibility after all, an expression of citizenship. But if you\\nbelieve that, then you have reason to question the market solution.Two generations after ending the draft, Americans hesitate to apply the full logic of market reasoning\\nto military service. The French Foreign Legion has a long tradition of recruiting foreign soldiers to fight\\nfor France. Although French law prohibits the Legion from active recruiting outside of France, the\\nInternet has made that restriction meaningless. Online recruiting in thirteen languages now attracts\\nrecruits from throughout the world. About a quarter of the force now comes from Latin America, and a\\ngrowing proportion comes from China and other Asian countries.\\n21\\nThe United States has not established a foreign legion, but it has taken a step in that direction. Faced\\nwith difficulties meeting recruiting \\ngoals as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have stretched on, the\\nmilitary has begun recruiting foreign immigrants currently living in the United States on temporary visas.\\nThe inducements include good pay and a fast track to American citizenship. About thirty thousand\\nnoncitizens now serve in the U.S. armed forces. The new program will extend eligibility from permanent\\nresidents with green cards to temporary immigrants, foreign students, and refugees.\\n22\\nThe recruitment of foreign troops is not the only way the logic of the market plays out. Once you view\\nmilitary service as a job like any other, there is no reason to assume the hiring must be done by the\\ngovernment. In fact, the United States now outsources military functions to private enterprise on a large\\nscale. Private military contractors play an increasing role in conflicts around the world, and form a\\nsubstantial part of the U.S. military presence in Iraq.\\nIn July 2007, the \\nLos Angeles Times\\n reported that the number of U.S.-paid private contractors in Iraq\\n(180,000) exceeded the number of U.S. military personnel stationed there (160,000).\\n23\\n Many of the\\ncontractors perform non-combat logistical support—building bases, repairing vehicles, delivering\\nsupplies, and providing food services. But about 50,000 are armed security operatives whose work\\nguarding bases, convoys, and diplomats often draws them into combat.\\n24\\n More than 1,200 private\\ncontractors have been killed in Iraq, though they do not return in flag-draped coffins, and their numbers\\nare not included in the U.S. military’s casualty count.\\n25\\nOne of the leading private military companies is Blackwater Worldwide. Erik Prince, the company’s\\nCEO, is a former Navy SEAL with an ardent faith in the free market. He rejects the suggestion that his\\nsoldiers are “mercenaries,” a term he considers “slanderous.”\\n26\\n Prince explains: “We’re trying to do for\\nthe national security apparatus what Federal Express did for the postal service.”\\n27\\n Blackwater received\\nover $1 billion in government contracts for its services in Iraq, but has often been at the center of\\ncontroversy.\\n28\\n Its role first came to public attention in 2004, when four of its employees were ambushed\\nand killed in \\nFallujah and two of the bodies were strung from a bridge. The incident led President George\\nW. Bush to order the Marines into Fallujah in a massive and costly battle with insurgents.\\nIn 2007, six Blackwater guards opened fire on a crowd in a Baghdad square, killing seventeen\\ncivilians. The guards, who claimed they had been fired upon first, were immune from prosecution under\\nIraqi law because of rules laid down by the American governing authority after the invasion. The\\ncontractors were eventually indicted for manslaughter by the U.S. Justice Department, and the incident\\nled the Iraqi government to demand the withdrawal of Blackwater from the country.\\n29\\nMany in Congress and in the public at large object to the outsourcing of war to for-profit companies\\nsuch as Blackwater. Much of the criticism focuses on the unaccountability of these companies, and their\\ninvolvement in abuses. Several years before the Blackwater shooting incident, private contractors from\\nother companies were among those who abused detainees at Abu Ghraib prison. Although the army\\nsoldiers involved were court-martialed, the private contractors were not punished.\\n30\\nBut suppose Congress tightened regulations on private military companies to make them more\\naccountable, and to hold their employees to the same standards of behavior that apply to U.S. troops.\\nWould the use of private companies to fight our wars cease to be objectionable? Or is there a moral\\ndifference between paying Federal Express to deliver the mail and hiring Blackwater to deliver lethal\\nforce on the battlefield?\\nTo answer this question, we have to resolve a prior one: Is military service (and perhaps national\\nservice generally) a civic obligation that all citizens have a duty to perform, or is it a hard and risky job\\nlike others (coal mining, for example, or commercial fishing) that is properly governed by the labor\\nmarket? And to answer this question, we have to ask a broader one: What obligations do citizens of a\\ndemocratic society owe to one another, and how do such obligations arise? Different theories of justiceoffer different answers to this question. We’ll be in a better \\nposition to decide whether we should draft\\nsoldiers or hire them once we explore, later in the book, the basis and scope of civic obligation. In the\\nmeantime, consider another controversial use of the labor market.\\nPregnancy for Pay\\nWilliam and Elizabeth Stern were a professional couple living in Tenafly, New Jersey—he a biochemist,\\nshe a pediatrician. They wanted a baby, but couldn’t have one on their own, at least not without medical\\nrisk to Elizabeth, who had multiple sclerosis. So they contacted an infertility center that arranged\\n“surrogate” pregnancies. The center ran ads seeking “surrogate mothers”—women willing to carry a\\nbaby to term for someone else, in exchange for a monetary payment.\\n31\\nOne of the women who had answered the ads was Mary Beth Whitehead, a twenty-nine-year-old\\nmother of two children, and the wife of a sanitation worker. In February 1985, William Stern and Mary\\nBeth Whitehead signed a contract. Mary Beth agreed to be artificially inseminated with William’s sperm,\\nto bear the child, and to hand it over to William upon birth. She also agreed to give up her maternal\\nrights, so that Elizabeth Stern could adopt the child. For his part, William agreed to pay Mary Beth a fee\\nof $10,000 (payable on delivery), plus medical expenses. (He also paid a fee of $7,500 to the infertility\\ncenter for arranging the deal.)\\nAfter several artificial inseminations, Mary Beth became pregnant, and in March 1986 she gave birth\\nto a baby girl. The Sterns, anticipating their soon-to-be adopted daughter, named her Melissa. But Mary\\nBeth Whitehead decided she could not part with the child, and wanted to keep it. She fled to Florida with\\nthe baby, but the Sterns got a court order requiring her to turn over the child. Florida police found Mary\\nBeth, the baby was given to the Sterns, and the custody fight went to court in New Jersey.\\nThe trial judge had to decide whether to enforce the contract. What do you think would be the right\\nthing to do? To simplify matters, let’s \\nfocus on the moral issue, rather than the law. (As it happens, New\\nJersey had no law either permitting or prohibiting surrogacy contracts at the time.) William Stern and\\nMary Beth Whitehead had made a contract. Morally speaking, should it have been enforced?\\nThe strongest argument in favor of upholding the contract is that a deal is a deal. Two consenting\\nadults had entered into a voluntary agreement that offered benefits to both parties: William Stern would\\nget a genetically related child, and Mary Beth Whitehead would earn $10,000 for nine months of work.\\nAdmittedly, this was no ordinary commercial deal. So you might hesitate to enforce it on one of two\\ngrounds: First, you might doubt that a woman’s agreement to have a baby and give it up for money is\\nfully informed. Can she really anticipate how she’ll feel once the time comes to give up the child? If not,\\nit might be argued that her initial consent was beclouded by the need for money, and by the lack of\\nadequate knowledge about what it would be like to part with her child. Second, you might find it\\nobjectionable to buy and sell babies, or to rent the reproductive capacity of women, even if both parties\\nfreely agree to do so. It could be argued that this practice turns children into commodities and exploits\\nwomen by treating pregnancy and child-bearing as a money-making business.\\nJudge Harvey R. Sorkow, the trial judge in the “Baby M” case, as it came to be known, was not\\npersuaded by either of these objections.\\n32\\n He upheld the agreement, invoking the sanctity of contracts.\\nA deal was a deal, and the birth mother had no right to break the contract simply because she’d changed\\nher mind.\\n33\\nThe judge addressed both objections. First, he rejected the notion that Mary Beth’s agreement was\\nless than voluntary, her consent somehow tainted:\\nNeither party has a superior bargaining position. Each had what the other wanted. A price for\\nthe service each was to perform was struck and a bargain reached. One did not force the\\nother. Neither had expertise \\nthat left the other at a disadvantage. Neither had disproportionate\\nbargaining power.\\n34\\nSecond, he rejected the notion that surrogacy amounts to baby-selling. The judge held that William\\nStern, the biological father, had not bought a baby from Mary Beth Whitehead; he’d paid her for the\\nservice of carrying his child to term. “At birth, the father does not purchase the child. It is his ownbiological genetically related child. He cannot purchase what is already his.”\\n35\\n Since the baby was\\nconceived with William’s sperm, it was his baby to begin with, the judge reasoned. Therefore, no baby-\\nselling was involved. The $10,000 payment was for a service (the pregnancy), not a product (the child).\\nAs for the claim that providing such a service exploits women, Judge Sorkow disagreed. He compared\\npaid pregnancy to paid sperm donation. Since men are allowed to sell their sperm, women should be\\nallowed to sell their reproductive capacities: “If a man may offer the means for procreation then a\\nwoman must equally be allowed to do so.”\\n36\\n To hold otherwise, he stated, would be to deny women the\\nequal protection of the law.\\nMary Beth Whitehead appealed the case to the New Jersey Supreme Court. In a unanimous opinion,\\nthe court overturned Judge Sorkow and ruled that the surrogacy contract was invalid.\\n37\\n The court\\nawarded custody of Baby M to William Stern, on the grounds that this was in the best interest of the\\nchild. Contract aside, the court believed the Sterns would do a better job of raising Melissa. But it\\nrestored Mary Beth Whitehead’s status as the child’s mother, and asked the lower court to determine\\nvisitation rights.\\nWriting for the court, Chief Justice Robert Wilentz rejected the surrogacy contract. He argued that it\\nwas not truly voluntary, and that it constituted baby-selling.\\nFirst, the consent was flawed. Mary Beth’s agreement to bear a child and surrender it at birth was not\\ntruly voluntary, because it was not fully informed:\\nUnder the contract, the natural mother is irrevocably committed before she knows the strength\\nof her bond with her child. She never makes a totally voluntary, informed decision, for quite\\nclearly any decision prior to the baby’s birth is, in the most important sense, uninformed.\\n38\\nOnce the baby is born, the mother is in a better position to make an informed choice. But by then, her\\ndecision is not free, but is compelled by “the threat of a lawsuit, and the inducement of a $10,000\\npayment,” making it “less than totally voluntary.”\\n39\\n Moreover, the need for money makes it likely that\\npoor women will “choose” to become surrogate mothers for the affluent, rather than the other way\\naround. Justice Wilentz suggested that this, too, called into question the voluntary character of such\\nagreements: “We doubt that infertile couples in the low-income bracket will find upper income\\nsurrogates.”\\n40\\nSo one reason for voiding the contract was tainted consent. But Wilentz also offered a second, more\\nfundamental reason:\\nPutting aside the issue of how compelling her need for money may have been, and how\\nsignificant her understanding of the consequences, we suggest that her consent is irrelevant.\\nThere are, in a civilized society, some things that money cannot buy.\\n41\\nCommercial surrogacy amounts to baby-selling, Wilentz argued, and baby-selling is wrong, however\\nvoluntary it may be. He rejected the argument that the payment is for the surrogate’s service rather than\\nfor the child. According to the contract, the $10,000 was payable only upon surrender of custody and\\nthe termination by Mary Beth of her parental rights.\\nThis is the sale of a child, or, at the very least, the sale of a mother’s right to her child, the only\\nmitigating factor being that one of the purchasers is the father. . . . [A] middle man, propelled by\\nprofit, \\npromotes the sale. Whatever idealism may have motivated any of the participants, the\\nprofit motive predominates, permeates, and ultimately governs the transaction.\\n42\\nSurrogacy Contracts and Justice\\nSo who was right in the Baby M case—the trial court that enforced the contract, or the higher court that\\ninvalidated it? To answer this question, we need to assess the moral force of contracts, and the two\\nobjections that were raised against the surrogacy contract.\\nThe argument for upholding the surrogacy contract draws on the two theories of justice we’veconsidered so far—libertarianism and utilitarianism. The libertarian case for contracts is that they reflect\\nfreedom of choice; to uphold a contract between two consenting adults is to respect their liberty. The\\nutilitarian case for contracts is that they promote the general welfare; if both parties agree to a deal,\\nboth must derive some benefit or happiness from the agreement—otherwise, they wouldn’t have made\\nit. So, unless it can be shown that the deal reduces someone else’s utility (and by more than it benefits\\nthe parties), mutually advantageous exchanges—including surrogacy contracts—should be upheld.\\nWhat about the objections? How convincing are they?\\nObjection 1: Tainted consent\\nThe first objection, about whether Mary Beth Whitehead’s agreement was truly voluntary, raises a\\nquestion about the conditions under which people make choices. It argues that we can exercise free\\nchoice only if we’re not unduly pressured (by the need for money, say), and if we’re reasonably well\\ninformed about the alternatives. Exactly what counts as undue pressure or the lack of informed consent\\nis open to argument. But the point of such arguments is to determine when a supposedly \\nvoluntary\\nagreement is really voluntary—and when it’s not. This question loomed large in the Baby M case, as it\\ndoes in debates about the volunteer army.\\nStepping back from the cases, it’s worth noticing that this debate, about the background conditions\\nnecessary for meaningful consent, is actually a family quarrel within one of the three approaches to\\njustice we consider in this book—the one that says justice means respecting freedom. As we’ve already\\nseen, libertarianism is one member of this family. It holds that justice requires respect for whatever\\nchoices people make, provided the choices don’t violate anyone’s rights. Other theories that view\\njustice as respecting freedom impose some restrictions on the conditions of choice. They say—as did\\nJustice Wilentz in the Baby M case—that choices made under pressure, or in the absence of informed\\nconsent, are not truly voluntary. We’ll be better equipped to assess this debate when we turn to the\\npolitical philosophy of John Rawls—a member of the freedom camp who rejects the libertarian account\\nof justice.\\nObjection 2: Degradation and higher goods\\nWhat about the second objection to surrogacy contracts—the one that says there are some things\\nmoney shouldn’t buy, including babies and women’s reproductive capacities? What exactly is wrong with\\nbuying and selling these things? The most compelling answer is that treating babies and pregnancy as\\ncommodities degrades them, or fails to value them appropriately.\\nUnderlying this answer is a far-reaching idea: The right way of valuing goods and social practices is\\nnot simply up to us. Certain modes of valuation are appropriate to certain goods and practices. In the\\ncase of commodities, such as cars and toasters, the proper way of valuing them is to use them, or to\\nmake them and sell them for profit. But it’s a mistake to treat all things as if they were commodities. It\\nwould be wrong, for example, to treat human beings as commodities, mere things to \\nbe bought and sold.\\nThat’s because human beings are persons worthy of respect, not objects to be used. Respect and use\\nare two different modes of valuation.\\nElizabeth Anderson, a contemporary moral philosopher, has applied a version of this argument to the\\nsurrogacy debate. She argues that surrogacy contracts degrade children and women’s labor by treating\\nthem as if they were commodities.\\n43\\n By degradation, she means treating something “in accordance with\\na lower mode of valuation than is proper to it. We value things not just ‘more’ or ‘less,’ but in\\nqualitatively higher and lower ways. To love or respect someone is to value her in a higher way than\\none would if one merely used her. . . . Commercial surrogacy degrades children insofar as it treats them\\nas commodities.”\\n44\\n It uses them as instruments of profit rather than cherishes them as persons worthy\\nof love and care.\\nCommercial surrogacy also degrades women, Anderson argues, by treating their bodies as factories\\nand by paying them not to bond with the children they bear. It replaces “the parental norms which usually\\ngovern the practice of gestating children with the economic norms which govern ordinary production.” By\\nrequiring the surrogate mother “to repress whatever parental love she feels for the child,” Andersonwrites, surrogacy contracts “convert women’s labor into a form of alienated labor.”\\n45\\nIn the surrogate contract, [the mother] agrees not to form or to attempt to form a parent-child\\nrelationship with her offspring. Her labor is alienated, because she must divert it from the end\\nwhich the social practices of pregnancy rightly promote—an emotional bond with her child.\\n46\\nCentral to Anderson’s argument is the idea that goods differ in kind; it’s therefore a mistake to value\\nall goods in the same way, as instruments of profit or objects of use. If this idea is right, it explains why\\nthere are some things money shouldn’t buy.\\nIt also poses a challenge to utilitarianism. If justice is simply a matter of maximizing the balance of\\npleasure over pain, we need a single, uniform way of weighing and valuing all goods and the pleasure or\\npain they give us. Bentham invented the concept of utility for precisely this purpose. But Anderson\\nargues that valuing everything according to utility (or money) degrades those goods and social practices\\n—including children, pregnancy, and parenting—that are properly valued according to higher norms.\\nBut what are those higher norms, and how can we know what modes of valuation are appropriate to\\nwhat goods and social practices? One approach to this question begins with the idea of freedom. Since\\nhuman beings are capable of freedom, we shouldn’t be used as if we were mere objects, but should be\\ntreated instead with dignity and respect. This approach emphasizes the distinction between persons\\n(worthy of respect) and mere objects or things (open to use) as the fundamental distinction in morality.\\nThe greatest defender of this approach is Immanuel Kant, to whom we turn in the next chapter.\\nAnother approach to higher norms begins with the idea that the right way of valuing goods and social\\npractices depends on the purposes and ends those practices serve. Recall that, in opposing surrogacy,\\nAnderson argues that “the social practices of pregnancy rightly promote” a certain end, namely an\\nemotional bond of a mother with her child. A contract that requires the mother not to form such a bond is\\ndegrading because it diverts her from this end. It replaces a “norm of parenthood” with a “norm of\\ncommercial production.” The notion that we identify the norms appropriate to social practices by trying\\nto grasp the characteristic end, or purpose, of those practices is at the heart of Aristotle’s theory of\\njustice. We will examine his approach in a later chapter.\\nUntil we examine these theories of morality and justice, we can’t really determine what goods and\\nsocial practices should be governed by markets. But the debate over surrogacy, like the argument over\\nthe volunteer army, gives us a glimpse of what’s at stake.\\nOutsourcing Pregnancy\\nMelissa Stern, once known as Baby M, recently graduated from George Washington University, where\\nshe majored in religion.\\n47\\n Over two decades have passed since her celebrated custody battle in New\\nJersey, but the debate over surrogate motherhood continues. Many European countries ban commercial\\nsurrogacy. In the United States, more than a dozen states have legalized the practice, about a dozen\\nstates prohibit it, while in other states its legal status is unclear.\\n48\\nNew reproductive technologies have changed the economics of surrogacy in ways that sharpen the\\nethical quandary it presents. When Mary Beth Whitehead agreed to undertake a pregnancy for pay, she\\nprovided both egg and womb. She was therefore the biological mother of the child she bore. But the\\nadvent of in vitro fertilization (IVF) makes it possible for one woman to provide the egg and another to\\ngestate it. Deborah Spar, a professor of business administration at the Harvard Business School, has\\nanalyzed the commercial advantages of the new surrogacy.\\n49\\n Traditionally, those who contracted for\\nsurrogacy “essentially needed to purchase a single package of egg-bundled-with-womb.” Now they can\\nacquire “the egg from one source (including, in many cases, the intended mother) and the womb from\\nanother.”\\n50\\nThis “unbundling” of the supply chain, Spar explains, has prompted growth in the surrogacy market.\\n51\\n“By removing the traditional link between egg, womb, and mother, gestational surrogacy [has] reduced\\nthe legal and emotional risks that had surrounded traditional surrogacy and allowed a new market to\\nthrive.” “Freed from the constraints of the egg-and-womb package,” surrogacy brokers are now “morediscriminating” in the surrogates they choose, “looking for eggs with particular genetic traits and wombs\\nattached to a certain personality.”\\n52\\n Prospective parents no longer need to worry about the genetic\\ncharacteristics of the woman they hire to carry their child, “because they’re acquiring those\\nelsewhere.”\\n53\\nThey don’t care what she looks like, and they are less worried that she will claim the child at\\nbirth or that courts would be inclined to find in her favor. All they really need is a healthy\\nwoman, willing to undergo pregnancy and to adhere to certain standards of behavior—no\\ndrinking, no smoking, no drugs—during its course.\\n54\\nAlthough gestational surrogacy has increased the supply of prospective surrogates, demand has\\nincreased as well. Surrogates now receive about $20,000 to $25,000 per pregnancy. The total cost of\\nthe arrangement (including medical bills and legal fees) is typically $75,000 to $80,000.\\nWith prices this steep, it’s not surprising to find that prospective parents have begun to seek less\\nexpensive alternatives. As with other products and services in a global economy, paid pregnancy is now\\noutsourced to low-cost providers. In 2002, India legalized commercial surrogacy in hopes of attracting\\nforeign customers.\\n55\\nThe western Indian city of Anand may soon be to paid pregnancy what Bangalore is to call centers. In\\n2008, more than fifty women in the city were carrying pregnancies for couples in the United States,\\nTaiwan, Britain, and elsewhere.\\n56\\n One clinic there provides group housing, complete with maids, cooks,\\nand doctors, for fifteen pregnant women serving as surrogates for clients around the world.\\n57\\n The\\nmoney the women earn, from $4,500 to $7,500, is often more than they would otherwise make in fifteen\\nyears, and enables them to buy a house or to finance their own children’s education.\\n58\\n For the\\nprospective parents who go to Anand, the arrangement is a bargain. At around $25,000 (including\\nmedical costs, the surrogate’s payment, round-trip airfare, and hotel expenses for two trips), the total\\ncost is about a third of what it would be for gestational surrogacy in the United States.\\n59\\nSome suggest that commercial surrogacy as practiced today is less morally troubling than the\\narrangement that led to the Baby M case. Since the surrogate does not provide the egg, only the womb\\nand the labor of pregnancy, it is argued, the child is not genetically hers. According \\nto this view, no baby\\nis being sold, and the claim to the child is less likely to be contested.\\nBut gestational surrogacy does not resolve the moral quandary. It may be true that gestational\\nsurrogates will be less attached to the children they bear than surrogates who also provide the egg. But\\ndividing the role of mother three ways (adopting parent, egg donor, and gestational surrogate) rather\\nthan two does not settle the question of who has the superior claim to the child.\\nIf anything, the outsourcing of pregnancy that has occurred due in part to IVF has cast the moral\\nissues in sharper relief. The substantial cost savings for prospective parents, and the enormous\\neconomic benefits, relative to local wages, that Indian surrogates derive from the practice, make it\\nundeniable that commercial surrogacy can increase the general welfare. So, from a utilitarian point of\\nview, it’s hard to argue with the rise of paid pregnancy as a global industry.\\nBut the global outsourcing of pregnancy also dramatizes the moral qualms. Suman Dodia, a twenty-\\nsix-year-old Indian who was a gestational surrogate for a British couple, had previously earned $25 per\\nmonth working as a maid. For her, the prospect of earning $4,500 for nine months’ work must have been\\nalmost too compelling to resist.\\n60\\n The fact that she had delivered her own three children at home and\\nnever visited a doctor adds poignancy to her role as a surrogate. Referring to her paid pregnancy, she\\nsaid, “I’m being more careful now than I was with my own pregnancies.”\\n61\\n Although the economic\\nbenefits of her choice to become a surrogate are clear, it’s not obvious that we would call it free.\\nMoreover, the creation of a paid pregnancy industry on global scale—as a deliberate policy in poor\\ncountries, no less—heightens the sense that surrogacy degrades women by instrumentalizing their\\nbodies and reproductive capacities.\\n \\nIt is hard to image two human activities more dissimilar than bearing children and fighting wars. But the\\npregnant surrogates in India and the \\nsoldier Andrew Carnegie hired to take his place in the Civil Warhave something in common. Thinking through the rights and wrongs of their situations brings us face to\\nface with two of the questions that divide competing conceptions of justice: How free are the choices\\nwe make in the free market? And are there certain virtues and higher goods that markets do not honor\\nand money cannot buy?5. WHAT MATTERS IS THE MOTIVE / IMMANUEL KANT\\nIf you believe\\n in universal human rights, you are probably not a utilitarian. If all human beings are\\nworthy of respect, regardless of who they are or where they live, then it’s wrong to treat them as mere\\ninstruments of the collective happiness. (Recall the story of the malnourished child languishing in the\\ncellar for the sake of the “city of happiness.”)\\nYou might defend human rights on the grounds that respecting them will maximize utility in the long run.\\nIn that case, however, your reason for respecting rights is not to respect the person who holds them but\\nto make things better for everyone. It is one thing to condemn the scenario of the suffering child\\nbecause it reduces overall utility, and something else to condemn it as an intrinsic moral wrong, an\\ninjustice to the child.\\nIf rights don’t rest on utility, what is their moral basis? Libertarians offer a possible answer: Persons\\nshould not be used merely as means to the welfare of others, because doing so violates the\\nfundamental right of self-ownership. My life, labor, and person belong to me and me alone. They are not\\nat the disposal of the society as a whole.\\nAs we have seen, however, the idea of self-ownership, consistently applied, has implications that only\\nan ardent libertarian can love—an unfettered market without a safety net for those who fall behind; a\\nminimal state that rules out most measures to ease inequality and promote the common good; and a\\ncelebration of consent so complete that it permits self-inflicted affronts to human dignity such as\\nconsensual cannibalism or selling oneself into slavery.\\nEven John Locke (1632–1704), the great theorist of property rights and limited government, does not\\nassert an unlimited right of self-possession. He rejects the notion that we may dispose of our life and\\nliberty however we please. But Locke’s theory of unalienable rights invokes God, posing a problem for\\nthose who seek a moral basis for rights that does not rest on religious assumptions.\\nKant’s Case for Rights\\nImmanuel Kant (1724–1804) offers an alternative account of duties and rights, one of the most powerful\\nand influential accounts any philosopher has produced. It does not depend on the idea that we own\\nourselves, or on the claim that our lives and liberties are a gift from God. Instead, it depends on the idea\\nthat we are rational beings, worthy of dignity and respect.\\nKant was born in the East Prussian city of Konigsberg in 1724, and died there, almost eighty years\\nlater. He came from a family of modest means. His father was a harness-maker and his parents were\\nPietists, members of a Protestant faith that emphasized the inner religious life and the doing of good\\nworks.\\n1\\nHe excelled at the University of Konigsberg, which he entered at age sixteen. For a time, he worked\\nas a private tutor, and then, at thirty-one, he received his first academic job, as an unsalaried lecturer,\\nfor which he was paid based on the number of students who showed up at his lectures. He was a\\npopular and industrious lecturer, giving about twenty lectures a week on subjects including metaphysics,\\nlogic, ethics, law, geography, and anthropology.\\nIn 1781, at age fifty-seven, he published his first major book, \\nThe Critique of Pure Reason\\n, which\\nchallenged the empiricist theory of \\nknowledge associated with David Hume and John Locke. Four years\\nlater, he published the \\nGroundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals\\n, the first of his several works on\\nmoral philosophy. Five years after Jeremy Bentham’s \\nPrinciples of Morals and Legislation\\n (1780),\\nKant’s \\nGroundwork\\n launched a devastating critique of utilitarianism. It argues that morality is not about\\nmaximizing happiness or any other end. Instead, it is about respecting persons as ends in themselves.\\nKant’s \\nGroundwork\\n appeared shortly after the American Revolution (1776) and just before the French\\nRevolution (1789). In line with the spirit and moral thrust of those revolutions, it offers a powerful basis\\nfor what the eighteenth-century revolutionaries called the rights of man, and what we in the early twenty-\\nfirst century call universal human rights.\\nKant’s philosophy is hard going. But don’t let that scare you away. It is worth the effort, because thestakes are enormous. The \\nGroundwork\\n takes up a big question: What is the supreme principle of\\nmorality? And in the course of answering that question, it addresses another hugely important one:\\nWhat is freedom?\\nKant’s answers to these questions have loomed over moral and political philosophy ever since. But\\nhis historical influence is not the only reason to pay attention to him. Daunting though Kant’s philosophy\\nmay seem at first glance, it actually informs much contemporary thinking about morality and politics,\\neven if we are unaware of it. So making sense of Kant is not only a philosophical exercise; it is also a\\nway of examining some of the key assumptions implicit in our public life.\\nKant’s emphasis on human dignity informs present-day notions of universal human rights. More\\nimportant, his account of freedom figures in many of our contemporary debates about justice. In the\\nintroduction to this book, I distinguished three approaches to justice. One approach, that of the\\nutilitarians, says that the way to define justice and to determine the right thing to do is to ask what will\\nmaximize welfare, or the collective happiness of society as a whole. A second approach connects\\njustice to freedom. Libertarians offer an example of \\nthis approach. They say the just distribution of\\nincome and wealth is whatever distribution arises from the free exchange of goods and services in an\\nunfettered market. To regulate the market is unjust, they maintain, because it violates the individual’s\\nfreedom of choice. A third approach says that justice means giving people what they morally deserve—\\nallocating goods to reward and promote virtue. As we will see when we turn to Aristotle (in Chapter 8),\\nthe virtue-based approach connects justice to reflection about the good life.\\nKant rejects approach one (maximizing welfare) and approach three (promoting virtue). Neither, he\\nthinks, respects human freedom. So Kant is a powerful advocate for approach two—the one that\\nconnects justice and morality to freedom. But the idea of freedom he puts forth is demanding—more\\ndemanding than the freedom of choice we exercise when buying and selling goods on the market. What\\nwe commonly think of as market freedom or consumer choice is not true freedom, Kant argues, because\\nit simply involves satisfying desires we haven’t chosen in the first place.\\nIn a moment, we’ll come to Kant’s more exalted idea of freedom. But before we do, let’s see why he\\nthinks the utilitarians are wrong to think of justice and morality as a matter of maximizing happiness.\\nThe Trouble with Maximizing Happiness\\nKant rejects utilitarianism. By resting rights on a calculation about what will produce the greatest\\nhappiness, he argues, utilitarianism leaves rights vulnerable. There is also a deeper problem: trying to\\nderive moral principles from the desires we happen to have is the wrong way to think about morality.\\nJust because something gives many people pleasure doesn’t make it right. The mere fact that the\\nmajority, however big, favors a certain law, however intensely, does not make the law just.\\nKant argues that morality can’t be based on merely empirical considerations, such as the interests,\\nwants, desires, and preferences people \\nhave at any given time. These factors are variable and\\ncontingent, he points out, so they could hardly serve as the basis for universal moral principles—such\\nas universal human rights. But Kant’s more fundamental point is that basing moral principles on\\npreferences and desires—even the desire for happiness—misunderstands what morality is about. The\\nutilitarian’s happiness principle “contributes nothing whatever toward establishing morality, since making\\na man happy is quite different from making him good and making him prudent or astute in seeking his\\nadvantage quite different from making him virtuous.”\\n2\\n Basing morality on interests and preferences\\ndestroys its dignity. It doesn’t teach us how to distinguish right from wrong, but “only to become better at\\ncalculation.”\\n3\\nIf our wants and desires can’t serve as the basis of morality, what’s left? One possibility is God. But\\nthat is not Kant’s answer. Although he was a Christian, Kant did not base morality on divine authority.\\nHe argues instead that we can arrive at the supreme principle of morality through the exercise of what\\nhe calls “pure practical reason.” To see how, according to Kant, we can reason our way to the moral\\nlaw, let’s now explore the close connection, as Kant sees it, between our capacity for reason and our\\ncapacity for freedom.\\nKant argues that every person is worthy of respect, not because we own ourselves but because we\\nare rational beings, capable of reason; we are also autonomous beings, capable of acting and choosingfreely.\\nKant doesn’t mean that we always succeed in acting rationally, or in choosing autonomously.\\nSometimes we do and sometimes we don’t. He means only that we have the capacity for reason, and\\nfor freedom, and that this capacity is common to human beings as such.\\nKant readily concedes that our capacity for reason is not the only capacity we possess. We also\\nhave the capacity to feel pleasure and pain. Kant recognizes that we are sentient creatures as well as\\nrational ones. By “sentient,” Kant means that we respond to our senses, our feelings. So Bentham was\\nright—but only half right. He was right to observe that we like pleasure and dislike pain. But he was\\nwrong to insist that \\nthey are “our sovereign masters.” Kant argues that reason can be sovereign, at\\nleast some of the time. When reason governs our will, we are not driven by the desire to seek pleasure\\nand avoid pain.\\nOur capacity for reason is bound up with our capacity for freedom. Taken together, these capacities\\nmake us distinctive, and set us apart from mere animal existence. They make us more than mere\\ncreatures of appetite.\\nWhat Is Freedom?\\nTo make sense of Kant’s moral philosophy, we need to understand what he means by freedom. We\\noften think of freedom as the absence of obstacles to doing what we want. Kant disagrees. He has a\\nmore stringent, demanding notion of freedom.\\nKant reasons as follows: When we, like animals, seek pleasure or the avoidance of pain, we aren’t\\nreally acting freely. We are acting as the slaves of our appetites and desires. Why? Because whenever\\nwe are seeking to satisfy our desires, everything we do is for the sake of some end given outside us. I\\ngo this way to assuage my hunger, that way to slake my thirst.\\nSuppose I’m trying to decide what flavor of ice cream to order: Should I go for chocolate, vanilla, or\\nespresso toffee crunch? I may think of myself as exercising freedom of choice, but what I’m really doing\\nis trying to figure out which flavor will best satisfy my preferences—preferences I didn’t choose in the\\nfirst place. Kant doesn’t say it’s wrong to satisfy our preferences. His point is that, when we do so, we\\nare not acting freely, but acting according to a determination given outside us. After all, I didn’t choose\\nmy desire for espresso toffee crunch rather than vanilla. I just have it.\\nSome years ago, Sprite had an advertising slogan: “Obey your thirst.” Sprite’s ad contained\\n(inadvertently, no doubt) a Kantian insight. When I pick up a can of Sprite (or Pepsi or Coke), I act out\\nof \\nobedience, not freedom. I am responding to a desire I haven’t chosen. I am obeying my thirst.\\nPeople often argue over the role of nature and nurture in shaping behavior. Is the desire for Sprite (or\\nother sugary drinks) inscribed in the genes or induced by advertising? For Kant, this debate is beside\\nthe point. Whenever my behavior is biologically determined or socially conditioned, it is not truly free. To\\nact freely, according to Kant, is to act autonomously. And to act autonomously is to act according to a\\nlaw I give myself—not according to the dictates of nature or social convention.\\nOne way of understanding what Kant means by acting autonomously is to contrast autonomy with its\\nopposite. Kant invents a word to capture this contrast—\\nheteronomy\\n. When I act heteronomously, I act\\naccording to determinations given outside of me. Here is an illustration: When you drop a billiard ball, it\\nfalls to the ground. As it falls, the billiard ball is not acting freely; its movement is governed by the laws of\\nnature—in this case, the law of gravity.\\nSuppose that I fall (or am pushed) from the Empire State Building. As I hurtle toward the earth, no one\\nwould say that I am acting freely; my movement is governed by the law of gravity, as with the billiard\\nball.\\nNow suppose I land on another person and kill that person. I would not be morally responsible for the\\nunfortunate death, any more than the billiard ball would be morally responsible if it fell from a great height\\nand hit someone on the head. In neither case is the falling object—me or the billiard ball—acting freely.\\nIn both cases, the falling object is governed by the law of gravity. Since there is no autonomy, there can\\nbe no moral responsibility.\\nHere, then, is the link between freedom as autonomy and Kant’s idea of morality. To act freely is not\\nto choose the best means to a given end; it is to choose the end itself, for its own sake—a choice that\\nhuman beings can make and billiard balls (and most animals) cannot.Persons and Things\\nIt is 3:00 a.m., and your college roommate asks you why you are up late pondering moral dilemmas\\ninvolving runaway trolleys.\\n“To write a good paper in Ethics 101,” you reply.\\n“But why write a good paper?” your roommate asks.\\n“To get a good grade.”\\n“But why care about grades?”\\n“To get a job in investment banking.”\\n“But why get a job in investment banking?”\\n“To become a hedge fund manager someday.”\\n“But why be a hedge fund manager?”\\n“To make a lot of money.”\\n“But why make a lot of money?”\\n“To eat lobster often, which I like. I am, after all, a sentient creature. \\nThat’s\\n why I’m up late thinking\\nabout runaway trolleys!”\\nThis is an example of what Kant would call heteronomous determination—doing something for the\\nsake of something else, for the sake of something else, and so on. When we act heteronomously, we\\nact for the sake of ends given outside us. We are instruments, not authors, of the purposes we pursue.\\nKant’s notion of autonomy stands in stark contrast to this. When we act autonomously, according to a\\nlaw we give ourselves, we do something for its own sake, as an end in itself. We cease to be\\ninstruments of purposes given outside us. This capacity to act autonomously is what gives human life its\\nspecial dignity. It marks out the difference between persons and things.\\nFor Kant, respecting human dignity means treating persons as ends in themselves. This is why it is\\nwrong to use people for the sake of the general welfare, as utilitarianism does. Pushing the heavy man\\nonto the track to block the trolley uses him as a means, and so fails to respect him as an end in himself.\\nAn enlightened utilitarian (such as Mill) may refuse to push the man, out of concern for secondary\\neffects that would \\ndiminish utility in the long run. (People would soon be afraid to stand on bridges, etc.)\\nBut Kant would maintain that this is the wrong reason to desist from pushing. It still treats the would-be\\nvictim as an instrument, an object, a mere means to the happiness of others. It lets him live, not for his\\nown sake, but so that other people can cross bridges without a second thought.\\nThis raises the question of what gives an action moral worth. It takes us from Kant’s specially\\ndemanding idea of freedom to his equally demanding notion of morality.\\nWhat’s Moral? Look for the Motive\\nAccording to Kant, the moral worth of an action consists not in the consequences that flow from it, but in\\nthe intention from which the act is done. What matters is the motive, and the motive must be of a certain\\nkind. What matters is doing the right thing because it’s right, not for some ulterior motive.\\n“A good will is not good because of what it effects or accomplishes,” Kant writes. It is good in itself,\\nwhether or not it prevails. “Even if . . . this will is entirely lacking in power to carry out its intentions; if by\\nits utmost effort it still accomplishes nothing . . . even then it would still shine like a jewel for its own sake\\nas something which has its full value in itself.”\\n4\\nFor any action to be morally good, “it is not enough that it should \\nconform\\n to the moral law—it must\\nalso be done for the sake of the moral law.”\\n5\\n And the motive that confers moral worth on an action is the\\nmotive of duty, by which Kant means doing the right thing for the right reason.\\n6\\nIn saying that only the motive of duty confers moral worth on an action, Kant is not yet saying what\\nparticular duties we have. He is not yet telling us what the supreme principle of morality commands. He’s\\nsimply observing that, when we assess the moral worth of an action, we assess the motive from which\\nit’s done, not the consequences it produces.\\n6\\nIf we act out of some motive other than duty, such as self-interest, for example, our action lacks moralworth. This is true, Kant maintains, not only for self-interest but for any and all attempts to satisfy our\\nwants, desires, preferences, and appetites. Kant contrasts motives such as these—he calls them\\n“motives of inclination”—with the motive of duty. And he insists that only actions done out of the motive\\nof duty have moral worth.\\nThe calculating shopkeeper and the Better Business Bureau\\nKant offers several examples that bring out the difference between duty and inclination. The first\\ninvolves a prudent shopkeeper. An inexperienced customer, say, a child, goes into a grocery store to\\nbuy a loaf of bread. The grocer could overcharge him—charge him more than the usual price for a loaf\\nof bread—and the child would not know. But the grocer realizes that, if others discovered he took\\nadvantage of the child in this way, word might spread and hurt his business. For this reason, he decides\\nnot to overcharge the child. He charges him the usual price. So the shopkeeper does the right thing, but\\nfor the wrong reason. The only reason he deals honestly with the child is to protect his reputation. The\\nshopkeeper acts honestly only for the sake of self-interest; the shopkeeper’s action lacks moral worth.\\n7\\nA modern-day parallel to Kant’s prudent shopkeeper can be found in the recruiting campaign of the\\nBetter Business Bureau of New York. Seeking to enlist new members, the BBB sometimes runs a full-\\npage ad in the \\nNew York Times\\n with the headline “Honesty is the best policy. It’s also the most\\nprofitable.” The text of the ad leaves no mistake about the motive being appealed to.\\nHonesty. It’s as important as any other asset. Because a business that deals in truth,\\nopenness, and fair value cannot help but do well. It is toward this end [that] we support the\\nBetter Business Bureau. Come join us. And profit from it.\\nKant would not condemn the Better Business Bureau; promoting honest business dealing is\\ncommendable. But there is an important moral difference between honesty for its own sake and honesty\\nfor the sake of the bottom line. The first is a principled position, the second a prudential one. Kant\\nargues that only the principled position is in line with the motive of duty, the only motive that confers\\nmoral worth on an action.\\nOr consider this example: Some years ago, the University of Maryland sought to combat a\\nwidespread cheating problem by asking students to sign pledges not to cheat. As an inducement,\\nstudents who took the pledge were offered a discount card good for savings of 10 to 25 percent at local\\nshops.\\n8\\n No one knows how many students promised not to cheat for the sake of a discount at the local\\npizza place. But most of us would agree that bought honesty lacks moral worth. (The discounts might or\\nmight not succeed in reducing the incidence of cheating; the moral question, however, is whether\\nhonesty motivated by the desire for a discount or a monetary reward has moral worth. Kant would say\\nno.)\\nThese cases bring out the plausibility of Kant’s claim that only the motive of duty—doing something\\nbecause it’s right, not because it’s useful or convenient—confers moral worth on an action. But two\\nfurther examples bring out a complexity in Kant’s claim.\\nStaying alive\\nThe first involves the duty, as Kant sees it, to preserve one’s own life. Since most people have a strong\\ninclination to continue living, this duty rarely comes into play. Most of the precautions we take to\\npreserve our lives therefore lack moral content. Buckling our seat belts and keeping our cholesterol in\\ncheck are prudential acts, not moral ones.\\nKant acknowledges that it is often difficult to know what motivates people to act as they do. And he\\nrecognizes that motives of duty and \\ninclination may both be present. His point is that only the motive of\\nduty—doing something because it’s right, not because it’s useful or pleasing or convenient—confers\\nmoral worth on an action. He illustrates this point with the example of suicide.\\nMost people go on living because they love life, not because they have a duty to do so. Kant offers a\\ncase where the motive of duty comes into view. He imagines a hopeless, miserable person so filled withdespair that he has no desire to go on living. If such a person summons the will to preserve his life, not\\nfrom inclination but from duty, then his action has moral worth.\\n9\\nKant does not maintain that only miserable people can fulfill the duty to preserve their lives. It is\\npossible to love life and still preserve it for the right reason—namely, that one has a duty to do so. The\\ndesire to go on living doesn’t undermine the moral worth of preserving one’s life, provided the person\\nrecognizes the duty to preserve his or her own life, and does so with this reason in mind.\\nThe moral misanthrope\\nPerhaps the hardest case for Kant’s view involves what he takes to be the duty to help others. Some\\npeople are altruistic. They feel compassion for others and take pleasure in helping them. But for Kant,\\ndoing good deeds out of compassion, “however right and however amiable it may be,” lacks moral\\nworth. This may seem counterintuitive. Isn’t it good to be the kind of person who takes pleasure in\\nhelping others? Kant would say yes. He certainly doesn’t think there is anything wrong with acting out of\\ncompassion. But he distinguishes between this motive for helping others—that doing the good deed\\ngives me pleasure—and the motive of duty. And he maintains that only the motive of duty confers moral\\nworth on an action. The compassion of the altruist “deserves praise and encouragement, but not\\nesteem.”\\n10\\nWhat, then, would it take for a good deed to have moral worth? \\nKant offers a scenario: Imagine that\\nour altruist suffers a misfortune that extinguishes his love of humanity. He becomes a misanthrope who\\nlacks all sympathy and compassion. But this cold-hearted soul tears himself out of his indifference and\\ncomes to the aid of his fellow human beings. Lacking any inclination to help, he does so “for the sake of\\nduty alone.” Now, for the first time, his action has moral worth.\\n11\\nThis seems in some ways an odd judgment. Does Kant mean to valorize misanthropes as moral\\nexemplars? No, not exactly. Taking pleasure in doing the right thing does not necessarily undermine its\\nmoral worth. What matters, Kant tells us, is that the good deed be done because it’s the right thing to do\\n—whether or not doing it gives us pleasure.\\nThe spelling bee hero\\nConsider an episode that took place some years ago at the national spelling bee in Washington, D.C. A\\nthirteen-year-old boy was asked to spell \\necholalia\\n, a word that means a tendency to repeat whatever\\none hears. Although he misspelled the word, the judges misheard him, told him he had spelled the word\\nright, and allowed him to advance. When the boy learned that he had misspelled the word, he went to\\nthe judges and told them. He was eliminated after all. Newspaper headlines the next day proclaimed the\\nhonest young man a “spelling bee hero,” and his photo appeared in \\nThe New York Times\\n. “The judges\\nsaid I had a lot of integrity,” the boy told reporters. He added that part of his motive was, “I didn’t want to\\nfeel like a slime.”\\n12\\nWhen I read that quote from the spelling bee hero, I wondered what Kant would think. Not wanting to\\nfeel like a slime is an inclination, of course. So, if that was the boy’s motive for telling the truth, it would\\nseem to undermine the moral worth of his act. But this seems too harsh. It would mean that only\\nunfeeling people could ever perform morally worthy acts. I don’t think this is what Kant means.\\nIf the only reason the boy told the truth was to avoid feeling guilty, or to avoid bad publicity should his\\nerror be discovered, then his truth-telling would lack moral worth. But if he told the truth because he\\nknew it was the right thing to do, his act has moral worth regardless of the pleasure or satisfaction that\\nmight attend it. As long as he did the right thing for the right reason, feeling good about it doesn’t\\nundermine its moral worth.\\nThe same is true of Kant’s altruist. If he comes to the aid of other people simply for the pleasure it\\ngives him, then his action lacks moral worth. But if he recognizes a duty to help one’s fellow human\\nbeings and acts out of that duty, then the pleasure he derives from it is not morally disqualifying.\\nIn practice, of course, duty and inclination often coexist. It is often hard to sort out one’s own motives,\\nlet alone know for sure the motives of other people. Kant doesn’t deny this. Nor does he think that only ahardhearted misanthrope can perform morally worthy acts. The point of his misanthrope example is to\\nisolate the motive of duty—to see it unclouded by sympathy or compassion. And once we glimpse the\\nmotive of duty, we can identify the feature of our good deeds that gives them their moral worth—namely,\\ntheir principle, not their consequences.\\nWhat Is the Supreme Principle of Morality?\\nIf morality means acting from duty, it remains to be shown what duty requires. To know this, for Kant, is\\nto know the supreme principle of morality. What is the supreme principle of morality? Kant’s aim in the\\nGroundwork\\n is to answer this question.\\nWe can approach Kant’s answer by seeing how he connects three big ideas: morality, freedom, and\\nreason. He explains these ideas through a series of contrasts or dualisms. They involve a bit of jargon,\\nbut if you notice the parallel among these contrasting terms, you are \\nwell on your way to understanding\\nKant’s moral philosophy. Here are the contrasts to keep in mind:\\n \\nContrast 1 (morality):\\nduty v. inclination\\nContrast 2 (freedom):\\nautonomy v. heteronomy\\nContrast 3 (reason):\\ncategorical v. hypothetical imperatives\\n \\nWe’ve already explored the first of these contrasts, between duty and inclination. Only the motive of\\nduty can confer moral worth on an action. Let me see if I can explain the other two.\\nThe second contrast describes two different ways that my will can be determined—autonomously and\\nheteronomously. According to Kant, I’m free only when my will is determined autonomously, governed by\\na law I give myself. Again, we often think of freedom as being able to do what we want, to pursue our\\ndesires unimpeded. But Kant poses a powerful challenge to this way of thinking about freedom: If you\\ndidn’t choose those desires freely in the first place, how can you think of yourself as free when you’re\\npursuing them? Kant captures this challenge in this contrast between autonomy and heteronomy.\\nWhen my will is determined heteronomously, it is determined externally, from outside of me. But this\\nraises a difficult question: If freedom means something more than following my desires and inclinations,\\nhow is it possible? Isn’t everything I do motivated by some desire or inclination determined by outside\\ninfluences?\\nThe answer is far from obvious. Kant observes that “everything in nature works in accordance with\\nlaws,” such as the laws of natural necessity, the laws of physics, the laws of cause and effect.\\n13\\n This\\nincludes us. We are, after all, natural beings. Human beings are not exempt from the laws of nature.\\nBut if we are capable of freedom, we must be capable of acting according to some other kind of law, a\\nlaw other than the laws of physics. Kant argues that all action is governed by laws of some kind or\\nother. \\nAnd if our actions were governed solely by the laws of physics, then we would be no different\\nfrom that billiard ball. So if we’re capable of freedom, we must be capable of acting not according to a\\nlaw that is given or imposed on us, but according to a law we give ourselves. But where could such a\\nlaw come from?\\nKant’s answer: from reason. We’re not only sentient beings, governed by the pleasure and pain\\ndelivered by our senses; we are also rational beings, capable of reason. If reason determines my will,\\nthen the will becomes the power to choose independent of the dictates of nature or inclination. (Notice\\nthat Kant isn’t asserting that reason always does govern my will; he’s only saying that, insofar as I’m\\ncapable of acting freely, according to a law I give myself, then it must be the case that reason can\\ngovern my will.)\\nOf course, Kant isn’t the first philosopher to suggest that human beings are capable of reason. But his\\nidea of reason, like his conceptions of freedom and morality, is especially demanding. For the empiricist\\nphilosophers, including the utilitarians, reason is wholly instrumental. It enables us to identify means for\\nthe pursuit of certain ends—ends that reason itself does not provide. Thomas Hobbes called reason the\\n“scout for the desires.” David Hume called reason the “slave of the passions.”\\nThe utilitarians viewed human beings as capable of reason, but only instrumental reason. Reason’s\\nwork, for the utilitarians, is not to determine what ends are worth pursuing. Its job is to figure out how to\\nmaximize utility by satisfying the desires we happen to have.Kant rejects this subordinate role for reason. For him, reason is not just the slave of the passions. If\\nthat were all reason amounted to, Kant says, we’d be better off with instinct.\\n14\\nKant’s idea of reason—of practical reason, the kind involved in morality—is not instrumental reason\\nbut “pure practical reason, which legislates a priori, regardless of all empirical ends.”\\n15\\nCategorical Versus Hypothetical Imperatives\\nBut how can reason do this? Kant distinguishes two ways that reason can command the will, two\\ndifferent kinds of imperative. One kind of imperative, perhaps the most familiar kind, is a hypothetical\\nimperative. Hypothetical imperatives use instrumental reason: If you want X, then do Y. If you want a\\ngood business reputation, then treat your customers honestly.\\nKant contrasts hypothetical imperatives, which are always conditional, with a kind of imperative that is\\nunconditional: a categorical imperative. “If the action would be good solely as a means to something\\nelse,” Kant writes, “the imperative is hypothetical. If the action is represented as good in itself, and\\ntherefore as necessary for a will which of itself accords with reason, then the imperative is\\ncategorical.”\\n16\\n The term \\ncategorical\\n may seem like jargon, but it’s not that distant from our ordinary use\\nof the term. By “categorical,” Kant means unconditional. So, for example, when a politician issues a\\ncategorical denial of an alleged scandal, the denial is not merely emphatic; it’s unconditional—without\\nany loophole or exception. Similarly, a categorical duty or categorical right is one that applies regardless\\nof the circumstances.\\nFor Kant, a categorical imperative commands, well, categorically—without reference to or\\ndependence on any further purpose. “It is concerned not with the matter of the action and its presumed\\nresults, but with its form, and with the principle from which it follows. And what is essentially good in the\\naction consists in the mental disposition, let the consequences be what they may.” Only a categorical\\nimperative, Kant argues, can qualify as an imperative of morality.\\n17\\nThe connection among the three parallel contrasts now comes into view. To be free in the sense of\\nautonomous requires that I act not out of a hypothetical imperative but out of a categorical imperative.\\nThis leaves one big question: What \\nis\\n the categorical imperative, and what does it command of us?\\nKant says we can answer this question \\nfrom the idea of “a practical law that by itself commands\\nabsolutely and without any further motives.”\\n18\\n We can answer this question from the idea of a law that\\nbinds us as rational beings regardless of our particular ends. So what is it?\\nKant offers several versions or formulations of the categorical imperative, which he believes all\\namount to the same thing.\\nCategorical imperative I: Universalize your maxim\\nThe first version Kant calls the formula of the universal law: “Act only on that maxim whereby you can at\\nthe same time will that it should become a universal law.”\\n19\\n By “maxim,” Kant means a rule or principle\\nthat gives the reason for your action. He is saying, in effect, that we should act only on principles that\\nwe could universalize without contradiction. To see what Kant means by this admittedly abstract test,\\nlet’s consider a concrete moral question: Is it ever right to make a promise you know you won’t be able\\nto keep?\\nSuppose I am in desperate need of money and so ask you for a loan. I know perfectly well that I won’t\\nbe able to pay it back anytime soon. Would it be morally permissible to get the loan by making a false\\npromise to repay the money promptly, a promise I know I can’t keep? Would a false promise be\\nconsistent with the categorical imperative? Kant says no, obviously not. The way I can see that the\\nfalse promise is at odds with the categorical imperative is by trying to universalize the maxim upon\\nwhich I’m about to act.\\n20\\nWhat is the maxim in this case? Something like this: “Whenever someone needs money badly, he\\nshould ask for a loan and promise to repay, even though he knows he won’t be able to do so.” If you\\ntried to universalize this maxim and at the same time to act on it, Kant says, you would discover acontradiction: If everybody made false promises when they needed money, nobody would believe such\\npromises. In fact, there would be no such thing as promises; universalizing the false promise would\\nundermine the institution of promise-keeping. But \\nthen it would be futile, even irrational, for you to try to\\nget money by promising. This shows that making a false promise is morally wrong, at odds with the\\ncategorical imperative.\\nSome people find this version of Kant’s categorical imperative unpersuasive. The formula of the\\nuniversal law bears a certain resemblance to the moral bromide grown-ups use to chastise children who\\ncut in line or speak out of turn: “What if everybody did that?” If everyone lied, then no one could rely on\\nanybody’s word, and we’d all be worse off. If this is what Kant is saying, he is making a consequentialist\\nargument after all—rejecting the false promise not in principle, but for its possibly harmful effects or\\nconsequences.\\nNo less a thinker than John Stuart Mill leveled this criticism against Kant. But Mill misunderstood\\nKant’s point. For Kant, seeing whether I could universalize the maxim of my action and continue acting\\non it is not a way of speculating about possible consequences. It is a test to see whether my maxim\\naccords with the categorical imperative. A false promise is not morally wrong because, writ large, it\\nwould undermine social trust (though it might well do so). It is wrong because, in making it, I privilege my\\nneeds and desires (in this case, for money) over everybody else’s. The universalizing test points to a\\npowerful moral claim: it’s a way of checking to see if the action I am about to undertake puts my\\ninterests and special circumstances ahead of everyone else’s.\\nCategorical imperative II: Treat persons as ends\\nThe moral force of the categorical imperative becomes clearer in Kant’s second formulation of it, the\\nformula of humanity as an end. Kant introduces the second version of the categorical imperative as\\nfollows: We can’t base the moral law on any particular interests, purposes, or ends, because then it\\nwould be only relative to the person whose ends they were. “But suppose there were something whose\\nexistence has in itself an absolute value,” as an end in itself. “Then in it, and in it alone, would there be\\nthe ground of a possible categorical imperative.”\\n21\\nWhat could possibly have an absolute value, as an end in itself? Kant’s answer: humanity. “I say that\\nman, and in general every rational being, exists as an end in himself, not merely as a means for\\narbitrary use by this or that will.”\\n22\\n This is the fundamental difference, Kant reminds us, between\\npersons and things. Persons are rational beings. They don’t just have a relative value, but if anything\\nhas, they have an absolute value, an intrinsic value. That is, rational beings have dignity.\\nThis line of reasoning leads Kant to the second formulation of the categorical imperative: “Act in such\\na way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never\\nsimply as a means, but always at the same time as an end.”\\n23\\n This is the formula of humanity as an\\nend.\\nConsider again the false promise. The second formulation of the categorical imperative helps us see,\\nfrom a slightly different angle, why it’s wrong. When I promise to repay you the money I hope to borrow,\\nknowing that I won’t be able to, I’m manipulating you. I’m using you as a means to my financial solvency,\\nnot treating you as an end, worthy of respect.\\nNow consider the case of suicide. What’s interesting to notice is that both murder and suicide are at\\nodds with the categorical imperative, and for the same reason. We often think of murder and suicide as\\nradically different acts, morally speaking. Killing someone else deprives him of his life against his will,\\nwhile suicide is the choice of the person who commits it. But Kant’s notion of treating humanity as an\\nend puts murder and suicide on the same footing. If I commit murder, I take someone’s life for the sake\\nof some interest of my own—robbing a bank, or consolidating my political power, or giving vent to my\\nanger. I use the victim as a means, and fail to respect his or her humanity as an end. This is why murder\\nviolates the categorical imperative.\\nFor Kant, suicide violates the categorical imperative in the same way. If I end my life to escape a\\npainful condition, I use myself as a means for the relief of my own suffering. But as Kant reminds us, a\\nperson is not a thing, “not something to be used merely as a means.” I have no more right to dispose of\\nhumanity in my own person than in \\nsomeone else. For Kant, suicide is wrong for the same reason thatmurder is wrong. Both treat persons as things, and fail to respect humanity as an end in itself.\\n24\\nThe suicide example brings out a distinctive feature of what Kant considers the duty to respect our\\nfellow human beings. For Kant, self-respect and respect for other persons flow from one and the same\\nprinciple. The duty of respect is a duty we owe to persons as rational beings, as bearers of humanity. It\\nhas nothing to do with who in particular the person may be.\\nThere is a difference between respect and other forms of human attachment. Love, sympathy,\\nsolidarity, and fellow feeling are moral sentiments that draw us closer to some people than to others. But\\nthe reason we must respect the dignity of persons has nothing to do with anything particular about them.\\nKantian respect is unlike love. It’s unlike sympathy. It’s unlike solidarity or fellow feeling. These reasons\\nfor caring about other people have to do with who they are in particular. We love our spouses and the\\nmembers of our family. We feel sympathy for people with whom we can identify. We feel solidarity with\\nour friends and comrades.\\nBut Kantian respect is respect for humanity as such, for a rational capacity that resides,\\nundifferentiated, in all of us. This explains why violating it in my own case is as objectionable as\\nviolating it in the case of someone else. It also explains why the Kantian principle of respect lends itself\\nto doctrines of universal human rights. For Kant, justice requires us to uphold the human rights of all\\npersons, regardless of where they live or how well we know them, simply because they are human\\nbeings, capable of reason, and therefore worthy of respect.\\nMorality and Freedom\\nWe can now see the link, as Kant conceives it, between morality and freedom. Acting morally means\\nacting out of duty—for the sake of the moral law. The moral law consists of a categorical imperative, a\\nprinciple \\nthat requires us to treat persons with respect, as ends in themselves. Only when I act in\\naccordance with the categorical imperative am I acting freely. For whenever I act according to a\\nhypothetical imperative, I act for the sake of some interest or end given outside of me. But in that case,\\nI’m not really free; my will is determined not by me, but by outside forces—by the necessities of my\\ncircumstance or by the wants and desires I happen to have.\\nI can escape the dictates of nature and circumstance only by acting autonomously, according to a law\\nI give myself. Such a law must be unconditioned by my particular wants and desires. So Kant’s\\ndemanding notions of freedom and morality are connected. Acting freely, that is, autonomously, and\\nacting morally, according to the categorical imperative, are one and the same.\\nThis way of thinking about morality and freedom leads Kant to his devastating critique of utilitarianism.\\nThe effort to base morality on some particular interest or desire (such as happiness or utility) was bound\\nto fail. “For what they discovered was never duty, but only the necessity of acting from a certain\\ninterest.” But any principle based on interest “was bound to be always a conditioned one and could not\\npossibly serve as a moral law.”\\n25\\nQuestions for Kant\\nKant’s moral philosophy is powerful and compelling. But it can be difficult to grasp, especially at first. If\\nyou have followed along so far, several questions may have occurred to you. Here are four especially\\nimportant ones.\\n \\nQUESTION 1:\\n \\nKant’s categorical imperative tells us to treat everyone with respect, as an end in itself.\\nIsn’t this pretty much the same as the Golden Rule? (“Do unto others as you would have them do unto\\nyou.”)\\nANSWER:\\n No. The Golden Rule depends on contingent facts about how people would like to be\\ntreated. The categorical imperative \\nrequires that we abstract from such contingencies and respect\\npersons as rational beings, regardless of what they might want in a particular situation.\\nSuppose you learn that your brother has died in a car accident. Your elderly mother, in frail\\ncondition in a nursing home, asks for news of him. You are torn between telling her the truth andcondition in a nursing home, asks for news of him. You are torn between telling her the truth and\\nsparing her the shock and agony of it. What is the right thing to do? The Golden Rule would ask,\\n“How would you like to be treated in a similar circumstance?” The answer, of course, is highly\\ncontingent. Some people would rather be spared harsh truths at vulnerable moments, while others\\nwant the truth, however painful. You might well conclude that, if you found yourself in your mother’s\\ncondition, you would rather not be told.\\nFor Kant, however, this is the wrong question to ask. What matters is not how you (or your\\nmother) would feel under these circumstances, but what it means to treat persons as rational\\nbeings, worthy of respect. Here is a case where compassion might point one way and Kantian\\nrespect another. From the standpoint of the categorical imperative, lying to your mother out of\\nconcern for her feelings would arguably use her as a means to her own contentment rather than\\nrespect her as a rational being.\\n \\nQUESTION 2:\\n \\nKant seems to suggest that answering to duty and acting autonomously are one and the\\nsame. But how can this be? Acting according to duty means having to obey a law. How can\\nsubservience to a law be compatible with freedom?\\nANSWER:\\n Duty and autonomy go together only in a special case—when I am the author of the law I\\nhave a duty to obey. My dignity as a free person does not consist in being subject to the moral law,\\nbut in being the author of “this very same law . . . and subordinated to it only on this ground.” When\\nwe abide by the categorical imperative, we abide by a law we have chosen. “The dignity of man\\nconsists precisely in his capacity to make universal law, \\nalthough only on condition of being himself\\nalso subject to the law he makes.”\\n26\\n \\nQUESTION 3:\\n \\nIf autonomy means acting according to a law I give myself, what guarantees that\\neveryone will choose the same moral law? If the categorical imperative is the product of my will, isn’t it\\nlikely that different people will come up with different categorical imperatives? Kant seems to think that\\nwe will all agree on the same moral law. But how can he be sure that different people won’t reason\\ndifferently, and arrive at various moral laws?\\nANSWER:\\n When we will the moral law, we don’t choose as you and me, particular persons that we\\nare, but as rational beings, as participants in what Kant calls “pure practical reason.” So it’s a\\nmistake to think that the moral law is up to us as individuals. Of course, if we reason from our\\nparticular interests, desires, and ends, we may be led to any number of principles. But these are not\\nmoral principles, only prudential ones. Insofar as we exercise pure practical reason, we abstract\\nfrom our particular interests. This means that everyone who exercises pure practical reason will\\nreach the same conclusion—will arrive at a single (universal) categorical imperative. “Thus a free\\nwill and a will under moral laws are one and the same.”\\n27\\n \\nQUESTION 4:\\n \\nKant argues that if morality is more than a matter of prudential calculation, it must take\\nthe form of a categorical imperative. But how can we know that morality exists apart from the play of\\npower and interests? Can we ever be sure that we are capable of acting autonomously, with a free\\nwill? What if scientists discover (through brain-imaging, for example, or cognitive neuroscience) that\\nwe have no free will after all: Would that disprove Kant’s moral philosophy?\\nANSWER:\\n Freedom of the will is not the kind of thing that science can prove or disprove. Neither is\\nmorality. It’s true that human beings inhabit the realm of nature. Everything we do can be described\\nfrom a physical or biological point of view. When I raise my hand to cast a vote, my action can be\\nexplained in terms of muscles, neurons, synapses, and cells. But it can also be explained in terms\\nof \\nideas and beliefs. Kant says we can’t help but understand ourselves from both standpoints—the\\nempirical realm of physics and biology, and an “intelligible” realm of free human agency.\\n \\nTo answer this question more fully, I need to say a bit more about these two standpoints. They are\\ntwo perspectives we can take on human agency, and on the laws that govern our actions. Here is how\\nKant describes the two standpoints:\\nA rational being . . . has two points of view from which he can regard himself and from which he\\ncan know laws governing . . . all his actions. He can consider himself \\nfirst\\n—so far as he\\nbelongs to the sensible world—to be under laws of nature (heteronomy); and \\nsecondly\\n—so faras he belongs to the intelligible world—to be under laws which, being independent of nature,\\nare not empirical but have their ground in reason alone.”\\n28\\nThe contrast between these two perspectives lines up with the three contrasts we have already\\ndiscussed:\\nContrast 1 (morality):\\nduty v. inclination\\nContrast 2 (freedom):\\nautonomy v. heteronomy\\nContrast 3 (reason):\\ncategorical v. hypothetical imperatives\\nContrast 4 (standpoints):\\nintelligible v. sensible realms\\nAs a natural being, I belong to the sensible world. My actions are determined by the laws of nature\\nand the regularities of cause and effect. This is the aspect of human action that physics, biology, and\\nneuroscience can describe. As a rational being, I inhabit an intelligible world. Here, being independent of\\nthe laws of nature, I am capable of autonomy, capable of acting according to a law I give myself.\\nKant argues that only from this second (intelligible) standpoint can I regard myself as free, “for to be\\nindependent of determination by \\ncauses in the sensible world (and this is what reason must always\\nattribute to itself) is to be free.”\\n29\\nIf I were only an empirical being, I would not be capable of freedom; every exercise of will would be\\nconditioned by some interest or desire. All choice would be heteronomous choice, governed by the\\npursuit of some end. My will could never be a first cause, only the effect of some prior cause, the\\ninstrument of one or another impulse or inclination.\\nInsofar as we think of ourselves as free, we cannot think of ourselves as merely empirical beings.\\n“When we think of ourselves as free, we transfer ourselves into the intelligible world as members and\\nrecognize the autonomy of the will together with its consequence—morality.”\\n30\\nSo—to return to the question—how are categorical imperatives possible? Only because “the idea of\\nfreedom makes me a member of the intelligible world.”\\n31\\n The idea that we can act freely, take moral\\nresponsibility for our actions, and hold other people morally responsible for their actions requires that we\\nsee ourselves from this perspective—from the standpoint of an agent, not merely an object. If you really\\nwant to resist this notion, and claim that human freedom and moral responsibility are utter illusions, then\\nKant’s account can’t prove you wrong. But it would be difficult if not impossible to understand ourselves,\\nto make sense of our lives, without some conception of freedom and morality. And any such conception,\\nKant thinks, commits us to the two standpoints—the standpoints of the agent and of the object. And\\nonce you see the force of this picture, you will see why science can never prove or disprove the\\npossibility of freedom.\\nRemember, Kant admits that we aren’t only rational beings. We don’t only inhabit the intelligible world.\\nIf we were only rational beings, not subject to the laws and necessities of nature, then all of our actions\\n“would invariably accord with the autonomy of the will.”\\n32\\n Because we inhabit, simultaneously, both\\nstandpoints—the realm of necessity and the realm of freedom—there is always potentially a gap\\nbetween what we do and what we ought to do, between the way things are and the way they ought to\\nbe.\\nAnother way of putting this point is to say that morality is not empirical. It stands at a certain distance\\nfrom the world. It passes judgment on the world. Science can’t, for all its power and insight, reach moral\\nquestions, because it operates within the sensible realm.\\n“To argue freedom away,” Kant writes, “is as impossible for the most abstruse philosophy as it is for\\nthe most ordinary human reason.”\\n33\\n It’s also impossible, Kant might have added, for cognitive\\nneuroscience, however sophisticated. Science can investigate nature and inquire into the empirical\\nworld, but it cannot answer moral questions or disprove free will. That is because morality and freedom\\nare not empirical concepts. We can’t prove that they exist, but neither can we make sense of our moral\\nlives without presupposing them.\\nSex, Lies, and Politics\\nOne way of exploring Kant’s moral philosophy is to see how he applied it to some concrete questions. Iwould like to consider three applications—sex, lies, and politics. Philosophers are not always the best\\nauthorities on how to apply their theories in practice. But Kant’s applications are interesting in their own\\nright and also shed some light on his philosophy as a whole.\\nKant’s case against casual sex\\nKant’s views on sexual morality are traditional and conservative. He opposes every conceivable sexual\\npractice except sexual intercourse between husband and wife. Whether all of Kant’s views on sex\\nactually follow from his moral philosophy is less important than the underlying idea they reflect—that we\\ndo not own ourselves and are not at our own disposal. He objects to casual sex (by which he means\\nsex outside of marriage), however consensual, on the grounds that it is degrading \\nand objectifying to\\nboth partners. Casual sex is objectionable, he thinks, because it is all about the satisfaction of sexual\\ndesire, not about respect for the humanity of one’s partner.\\nThe desire which a man has for a woman is not directed toward her because she is a human\\nbeing, but because she is a woman; that she is a human being is of no concern to the man;\\nonly her sex is the object of his desires.\\n34\\nEven when casual sex involves the mutual satisfaction of the partners, “each of them dishonours the\\nhuman nature of the other. They make of humanity an instrument for the satisfaction of their lusts and\\ninclinations.”\\n35\\n (For reasons we’ll come to in a moment, Kant thinks marriage elevates sex by taking it\\nbeyond physical gratification and connecting it with human dignity.)\\nTurning to the question of whether prostitution is moral or immoral, Kant asks under what conditions\\nthe use of our sexual faculties is in keeping with morality. His answer, in this as in other situations, is\\nthat we should not treat others—or ourselves—merely as objects. We are not at our own disposal. In\\nstark contrast to libertarian notions of self-possession, Kant insists that we do not own ourselves. The\\nmoral requirement that we treat persons as ends rather than as mere means limits the way we may treat\\nour bodies and ourselves. “Man cannot dispose over himself because he is not a thing; he is not his\\nown property.”\\n36\\nIn contemporary debates about sexual morality, those who invoke autonomy rights argue that\\nindividuals should be free to choose for themselves what use to make of their own bodies. But this isn’t\\nwhat Kant means by autonomy. Paradoxically, Kant’s conception of autonomy imposes certain limits on\\nthe way we may treat ourselves. For, recall: To be autonomous is to be governed by a law I give myself\\n—the categorical imperative. And the categorical imperative requires that I treat all persons (including\\nmyself) with respect—as an end, not \\nmerely as a means. So, for Kant, acting autonomously requires\\nthat we treat ourselves with respect, and not objectify ourselves. We can’t use our bodies any way we\\nplease.\\nMarkets in kidneys were not prevalent in Kant’s day, but the rich did buy teeth for implantation from\\nthe poor. (\\nTransplanting of Teeth\\n, a drawing by the eighteenth-century English caricaturist Thomas\\nRowlandson, shows a scene in a dentist’s office in which a surgeon extracts teeth from a chimney\\nsweep while wealthy women wait for their implants.) Kant considered this practice a violation of human\\ndignity. A person “is not entitled to sell a limb, not even one of his teeth.”\\n37\\n To do so is to treat oneself\\nas an object, a mere means, an instrument of profit.\\nKant found prostitution objectionable on the same grounds. “To allow one’s person for profit to be\\nused by another for the satisfaction of sexual desire, to make of oneself an object of demand, is to . . .\\nmake of oneself a thing on which another satisfies his appetite, just as he satisfies his hunger upon a\\nsteak.” Human beings are “not entitled to offer themselves, for profit, as things for the use of others in\\nthe satisfaction of their sexual propensities.” To do so is to treat one’s person as a mere thing, an\\nobject of use. “The underlying moral principle is that man is not his own property and cannot do with his\\nbody what he will.”\\n38\\nKant’s opposition to prostitution and casual sex brings out the contrast between autonomy as he\\nconceives it—the free will of a rational being—and individual acts of consent. The moral law we arrive at\\nthrough the exercise of our will requires that we treat humanity—in our own person and in others—neveronly as a means but as an end in itself. Although this moral requirement is based on autonomy, it rules\\nout certain acts among consenting adults, namely those that are at odds with human dignity and self-\\nrespect.\\nKant concludes that only sex within marriage can avoid “degrading humanity.” Only when two persons\\ngive each other the whole of themselves, and not merely the use of their sexual capacities, can sex be\\nother than objectifying. Only when both partners share with each other \\ntheir “person, body and soul, for\\ngood and ill and in every respect,” can their sexuality lead to “a union of human beings.”\\n39\\n Kant does\\nnot say that every marriage actually brings about a union of this kind. And he may be wrong to think that\\nno such unions can ever occur outside of marriage, or that sexual relations outside of marriage involve\\nnothing more than sexual gratification. But his views about sex highlight the difference between two\\nideas that are often confused in contemporary debate—between an ethic of unfettered consent and an\\nethic of respect for the autonomy and dignity of persons.\\nIs it wrong to lie to a murderer?\\nKant takes a hard line against lying. In the \\nGroundwork\\n, it serves as a prime example of immoral\\nbehavior. But suppose a friend was hiding in your house, and a murderer came to the door looking for\\nhim. Wouldn’t it be right to lie to the murderer? Kant says no. The duty to tell the truth holds regardless\\nof the consequences.\\nBenjamin Constant, a French philosopher and contemporary of Kant, took issue with this\\nuncompromising stance. The duty to tell the truth applies, Constant argued, only to those who deserve\\nthe truth, as surely the murderer does not. Kant replied that lying to the murderer is wrong, not because\\nit harms him, but because it violates the principle of right: “Truthfulness in statements that cannot be\\navoided is the formal duty of man to everyone, however great the disadvantage that may arise\\ntherefrom for him or for any other.”\\n40\\nAdmittedly, helping a murderer carry out his evil deed is a pretty heavy “disadvantage.” But remember,\\nfor Kant, morality is not about consequences; it’s about principle. You can’t control the consequences of\\nyour action—in this case, telling the truth—since consequences are bound up with contingency. For all\\nyou know, your friend, fearing that the murderer is on his way, has already slipped out the back door.\\nThe reason you must tell the truth, Kant states, is not that the murderer is entitled to the truth, or that a\\nlie would harm him. It’s that a lie—any \\nlie—“vitiates the very source of right . . . To be truthful (honest) in\\nall declarations is, therefore, a sacred and unconditionally commanding law of reason that admits of no\\nexpediency whatsoever.”\\n41\\nThis seems a strange and extreme position. Surely we don’t have a moral duty to tell a Nazi storm\\ntrooper that Anne Frank and her family are hiding in the attic. It would seem that Kant’s insistence on\\ntelling the truth to the murderer at the door either misapplies the categorical imperative or proves its\\nfolly.\\nImplausible though Kant’s claim may seem, I would like to offer a certain defense of it. Although my\\ndefense differs from the one that Kant offers, it is nonetheless in the spirit of his philosophy, and, I hope,\\nsheds some light on it.\\nImagine yourself in the predicament with a friend hiding in the closet and the murderer at the door. Of\\ncourse you don’t want to help the murderer carry out his evil plan. That is a given. You don’t want to say\\nanything that will lead the murderer to your friend. The question is, what do you say? You have two\\nchoices. You could tell an outright lie: “No, she’s not here.” Or you could offer a true but misleading\\nstatement: “An hour ago, I saw her down the road, at the grocery store.”\\nFrom Kant’s point of view, the second strategy is morally permissible, but the first is not. You might\\nconsider this caviling. What, morally speaking, is the difference between a technically true but\\nmisleading statement and an outright lie? In both cases, you are hoping to mislead the murderer into\\nbelieving that your friend is not hiding in the house.\\nKant believes a great deal is at stake in the distinction. Consider “white lies,” the small untruths we\\nsometimes tell out of politeness, to avoid hurt feelings. Suppose a friend presents you with a gift. You\\nopen the box and find a hideous tie, something you would never wear. What do you say? You might\\nsay, “It’s beautiful!” This would be a white lie. Or you might say, “You shouldn’t have!” Or, “I’ve neverseen a tie like this. Thank you.” Like the white lie, these statements might give your friend the false\\nimpression that you like the tie. But they would nonetheless be true.\\nKant would reject the white lie, because it makes an exception to the moral law on consequentialist\\ngrounds. Sparing someone’s feelings is an admirable end, but it must be pursued in a way that is\\nconsistent with the categorical imperative, which requires that we be willing to universalize the principle\\non which we act. If we can carve out exceptions whenever we think our ends are sufficiently compelling,\\nthen the categorical character of the moral law unravels. The true but misleading statement, by contrast,\\ndoes not threaten the categorical imperative in the same way. In fact, Kant once invoked this distinction\\nwhen faced with a dilemma of his own.\\nWould Kant have defended Bill Clinton?\\nA few years before his exchange with Constant, Kant found himself in trouble with King Friedrich\\nWilhelm II. The king and his censors considered Kant’s writings on religion disparaging to Christianity,\\nand demanded that he pledge to refrain from any further pronouncements on the topic. Kant responded\\nwith a carefully worded statement: “As your Majesty’s faithful subject, I shall in the future completely\\ndesist from all public lectures or papers concerning religion.”\\n42\\nKant was aware, when he made his statement, that the king was not likely to live much longer. When\\nthe king died a few years later, Kant considered himself absolved of the promise, which bound him only\\n“as your Majesty’s faithful subject.” Kant later explained that he had chosen his words “most carefully,\\nso that I should not be deprived of my freedom . . . forever, but only so long as His Majesty was\\nalive.”\\n43\\n By this clever evasion, the paragon of Prussian probity succeeded in misleading the censors\\nwithout lying to them.\\nHairsplitting? Perhaps. But something of moral significance does seem to be at stake in the distinction\\nbetween a bald-faced lie and an artful dodge. Consider former president Bill Clinton. No American public\\nfigure in recent memory chose his words or crafted his denials more carefully. When asked, during his\\nfirst presidential campaign, \\nwhether he had ever used recreational drugs, Clinton replied that he had\\nnever broken the antidrug laws of his country or state. He later conceded that he had tried marijuana\\nwhile a student at Oxford in England.\\nHis most memorable such denial came in response to reports that he had had sex in the White House\\nwith a twenty-two-year-old intern, Monica Lewinsky: “I want to say one thing to the American people. I\\nwant you to listen to me . . . I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky.”\\nIt later came out that the president did have sexual encounters with Monica Lewinsky, and the\\nscandal led to impeachment proceedings. During the impeachment hearings, a Republican congressman\\nargued with a Clinton attorney, Gregory Craig, over whether the president’s denial of “sexual relations”\\nwas a lie:\\n \\nREP. BOB INGLIS (R-S.C.):\\n Now, Mr. Craig, did he lie to the American people when he said, “I never\\nhad sex with that woman”? Did he lie?\\nCRAIG:\\n He certainly misled and deceived—\\nINGLIS:\\n Wait a minute, now. Did he lie?\\nCRAIG:\\n To the American people—he misled them and did not tell them the truth at that moment.\\nINGLIS:\\n OK, so you’re not going to rely—and the President has personally insisted . . . that no\\nlegalities or technicalities should be allowed to obscure the simple moral truth. Did he lie to the\\nAmerican people when he said, “I never had sex with that woman”?\\nCRAIG:\\n He doesn’t believe he did and because of the way—let me explain that—explain,\\nCongressman.\\nINGLIS:\\n He doesn’t believe that he lied?\\nCRAIG:\\n No, he does not believe that he lied, because his notion of what sex is, is what the\\ndictionary definition is. It is in fact something you may not agree with, but in his own mind, his\\ndefinition was not—\\nINGLIS:\\n OK, I understand that argument.\\nCRAIG:\\n OK.\\nINGLIS:\\n This is an amazing thing, that you now sit before us and you’re taking back all of his—all ofhis apologies.\\nCRAIG:\\n No.\\nINGLIS:\\n You’re taking them all back, aren’t you?\\nCRAIG:\\n No, I’m not.\\nINGLIS:\\n Because now you’re back to the argument—there are many arguments you can make here.\\nOne of them is he didn’t have sex with her. It was oral sex, it wasn’t real sex. Now is that what\\nyou’re here to say to us today, that he did not have sex with Monica Lewinsky?\\nCRAIG:\\n What he said was, to the American people, that he did not have sexual relations. And I\\nunderstand you’re not going to like this, Congressman, because it—you will see it as a technical\\ndefense or a hairsplitting, evasive answer. But sexual relations is defined in every dictionary in a\\ncertain way, and he did not have that kind of sexual contact with Monica Lewinsky . . . So, did he\\ndeceive the American people? Yes. Was it wrong? Yes. Was it blameworthy? Yes.\\n44\\n \\nThe president’s attorney conceded, as Clinton had already done, that the relationship with the intern\\nwas wrong, inappropriate, and blameworthy, and that the president’s statements about it “misled and\\ndeceived” the public. The only thing he refused to concede was that the president had lied.\\nWhat was at stake in that refusal? The explanation can’t simply be the legalistic one that lying under\\noath, in a deposition or in court, is a basis for perjury charges. The statement at issue was not made\\nunder oath, but in a televised statement to the American public. And yet both the Republican inquisitor\\nand the Clinton defender believed that something important was at stake in establishing whether Clinton\\nhad lied or merely misled and deceived. Their spirited colloquy over the \\nL\\n word—“Did he lie?”—supports\\nthe Kantian thought that there is a morally relevant difference between a lie and a misleading truth.\\nBut what could that difference be? The intention is arguably the same in both cases. Whether I lie to\\nthe murderer at the door or offer him a clever evasion, my intention is to mislead him into thinking that\\nmy friend is not hiding in my house. And on Kant’s moral theory, it’s the intention, or motive, that\\nmatters.\\nThe difference, I think, is this: A carefully crafted evasion pays homage to the duty of truth-telling in a\\nway that an outright lie does not. Anyone who goes to the bother of concocting a misleading but\\ntechnically true statement when a simple lie would do expresses, however obliquely, respect for the\\nmoral law.\\nA misleading truth includes two motives, not one. If I simply lie to the murderer, I act out of one motive\\n—to protect my friend from harm. If I tell the murderer that I recently saw my friend at the grocery store, I\\nact out of two motives—to protect my friend and at the same time to uphold the duty to tell the truth. In\\nboth cases, I am pursuing an admirable goal, that of protecting my friend. But only in the second case do\\nI pursue this goal in a way that accords with the motive of duty.\\nSome might object that, like a lie, a technically true but misleading statement could not be\\nuniversalized without contradiction. But consider the difference: If everyone lied when faced with a\\nmurderer at the door or an embarrassing sex scandal, then no one would believe such statements, and\\nthey wouldn’t work. The same cannot be said of misleading truths. If everyone who found himself in a\\ndangerous or embarrassing situation resorted to carefully crafted evasions, people would not\\nnecessarily cease to believe them. Instead, people would learn to listen like lawyers and parse such\\nstatements with an eye to their literal meaning. This is exactly what happened when the press and the\\npublic became familiar with Clinton’s carefully worded denials.\\nKant’s point is not that this state of affairs, in which people parse politicians’ denials for their literal\\nmeaning, is somehow better than one in which nobody believes politicians at all. That would be a\\nconsequentialist argument. Kant’s point is rather that a misleading statement that is nonetheless true\\ndoes not coerce or manipulate the listener in \\nthe same way as an outright lie. It’s always possible that a\\ncareful listener could figure it out.\\nSo there is reason to conclude that, on Kant’s moral theory, true but misleading statements—to a\\nmurderer at the door, the Prussian censors, or the special prosecutor—are morally permissible in a way\\nthat bald-faced lies are not. You may think that I’ve worked too hard to save Kant from an implausible\\nposition. Kant’s claim that it’s wrong to lie to the murderer at the door may not ultimately be defensible.\\nBut the distinction between an outright lie and a misleading truth helps illustrate Kant’s moral theory. And\\nit brings out a surprising similarity between Bill Clinton and the austere moralist from Konigsberg.Kant and justice\\nUnlike Aristotle, Bentham, and Mill, Kant wrote no major work of political theory, only some essays. And\\nyet, the account of morality and freedom that emerges from his ethical writings carries powerful\\nimplications for justice. Although Kant does not work out the implications in detail, the political theory he\\nfavors rejects utilitarianism in favor of a theory of justice based on a social contract.\\nFirst, Kant rejects utilitarianism, not only as a basis for personal morality but also as a basis for law.\\nAs he sees it, a just constitution aims at harmonizing each individual’s freedom with that of everyone\\nelse. It has nothing to do with maximizing utility, which “must on no account interfere” with the\\ndetermination of basic rights. Since people “have different views on the empirical end of happiness and\\nwhat it consists of,” utility can’t be the basis of justice and rights. Why not? Because resting rights on\\nutility would require the society to affirm or endorse one conception of happiness over others. To base\\nthe constitution on one particular conception of happiness (such as that of the majority) would impose\\non some the values of others; it would fail to respect the right of each person to pursue his or her own\\nends. “No one can compel me to be happy in accordance with his conception of the welfare of \\nothers,”\\nKant writes, “for each may seek his happiness in whatever way he sees fit, so long as he does not\\ninfringe upon the freedom of others” to do the same.\\n45\\nA second distinctive feature of Kant’s political theory is that it derives justice and rights from a social\\ncontract—but a social contract with a puzzling twist. Earlier contract thinkers, including Locke, argued\\nthat legitimate government arises from a social contract among men and women who, at one time or\\nanother, decide among themselves on the principles that will govern their collective life. Kant sees the\\ncontract differently. Although legitimate government must be based on an original contract, “we need by\\nno means assume that this contract . . . actually exists as a \\nfact\\n, for it cannot possibly be so.” Kant\\nmaintains that the original contract is not actual but imaginary.\\n46\\nWhy derive a just constitution from an imaginary contract rather than a real one? One reason is\\npractical: It’s often hard to prove historically, in the distant history of nations, that any social contract\\never took place. A second reason is philosophical: Moral principles can’t be derived from empirical facts\\nalone. Just as the moral law can’t rest on the interests or desires of individuals, principles of justice\\ncan’t rest on the interests or desires of a community. The mere fact that a group of people in the past\\nagreed to a constitution is not enough to make that constitution just.\\nWhat kind of imaginary contract could possibly avoid this problem? Kant simply calls it “an \\nidea\\n of\\nreason, which nonetheless has undoubted practical reality; for it can oblige every legislator to frame his\\nlaws in such a way that they could have been produced by the united will of a whole nation,” and\\nobligate each citizen “as if he had consented.” Kant concludes that this imaginary act of collective\\nconsent “is the test of the rightfulness of every public law.”\\n47\\nKant didn’t tell us what this imaginary contract would look like or what principles of justice it would\\nproduce. Almost two centuries later, an American political philosopher, John Rawls, would try to answer\\nthese questions.6. THE CASE FOR EQUALITY / JOHN RAWLS\\nMost of us Americans\\n never signed a social contract. In fact, the only people in the United States who\\nhave actually agreed to abide by the Constitution (public officials aside) are naturalized citizens—\\nimmigrants who have taken an oath of allegiance as a condition of their citizenship. The rest of us are\\nnever required, or even asked, to give our consent. So why are we obligated to obey the law? And how\\ncan we say that our government rests on the consent of the governed?\\nJohn Locke says we’ve given tacit consent. Anyone who enjoys the benefits of a government, even\\nby traveling on the highway, implicitly consents to the law, and is bound by it.\\n1\\n But tacit consent is a\\npale form of the real thing. It is hard to see how just passing through town is morally akin to ratifying the\\nConstitution.\\nImmanuel Kant appeals to hypothetical consent. A law is just if it could have been agreed to by the\\npublic as a whole. But this, too, is a puzzling alternative to an actual social contract. How can a\\nhypothetical agreement do the moral work of a real one?\\nJohn Rawls (1921–2002), an American political philosopher, offers an illuminating answer to this\\nquestion. In \\nA Theory of Justice\\n (1971), he argues that the way to think about justice is to ask what\\nprinciples we would agree to in an initial situation of equality.\\n2\\nRawls reasons as follows: Suppose we gathered, just as we are, to choose the principles to govern\\nour collective life—to write a social contract. What principles would we choose? We would probably find\\nit difficult to agree. Different people would favor different principles, reflecting their various interests,\\nmoral and religious beliefs, and social positions. Some people are rich and some are poor; some are\\npowerful and well connected; others, less so. Some are members of racial, ethnic, or religious\\nminorities; others, not. We might settle on a compromise. But even the compromise would likely reflect\\nthe superior bargaining power of some over others. There is no reason to assume that a social contract\\narrived at in this way would be a just arrangement.\\nNow consider a thought experiment: Suppose that when we gather to choose the principles, we don’t\\nknow where we will wind up in society. Imagine that we choose behind a “veil of ignorance” that\\ntemporarily prevents us from knowing anything about who in particular we are. We don’t know our class\\nor gender, our race or ethnicity, our political opinions or religious convictions. Nor do we know our\\nadvantages and disadvantages—whether we are healthy or frail, highly educated or a high-school\\ndropout, born to a supportive family or a broken one. If no one knew any of these things, we would\\nchoose, in effect, from an original position of equality. Since no one would have a superior bargaining\\nposition, the principles we would agree to would be just.\\nThis is Rawls’s idea of the social contract—a hypothetical agreement in an original position of\\nequality. Rawls invites us to ask what principles we—as rational, self-interested persons—would\\nchoose if we found ourselves in that position. He doesn’t assume that we are all motivated by self-\\ninterest in real life; only that we set aside our moral and religious convictions for purposes of the thought\\nexperiment. What principles would we choose?\\nFirst of all, he reasons, we would not choose utilitarianism. Behind the veil of ignorance, each of us\\nwould think, “For all I know, I might wind up being a member of an oppressed minority.” And no one would\\nwant to risk being the Christian thrown to the lions for the pleasure of the crowd. Nor would we choose a\\npurely laissez-faire, libertarian principle that would give people a right to keep all the money they made in\\na market economy. “I might wind up being Bill Gates,” each person would reason, “but then again, I might\\nturn out to be a homeless person. So I’d better avoid a system that could leave me destitute and without\\nhelp.”\\nRawls believes that two principles of justice would emerge from the hypothetical contract. The first\\nprovides equal basic liberties for all citizens, such as freedom of speech and religion. This principle\\ntakes priority over considerations of social utility and the general welfare. The second principle\\nconcerns social and economic equality. Although it does not require an equal distribution of income and\\nwealth, it permits only those social and economic inequalities that work to the advantage of the least\\nwell off members of society.\\nPhilosophers argue about whether or not the parties to Rawls’s hypothetical social contract wouldchoose the principles he says they would. In a moment, we’ll see why Rawls thinks these two principles\\nwould be chosen. But before turning to the principles, let’s take up a prior question: Is Rawls’s thought\\nexperiment the right way to think about justice? How can principles of justice possibly be derived from\\nan agreement that never actually took place?\\nThe Moral Limits of Contracts\\nTo appreciate the moral force of Rawls’s hypothetical contract, it helps to notice the moral limits of\\nactual contracts. We sometimes assume that, when two people make a deal, the terms of their\\nagreement must be fair. We assume, in other words, that contracts justify the terms that they produce.\\nBut they don’t—at least not on their own. Actual contracts are not self-sufficient moral instruments. The\\nmere fact that you and I make a deal is not enough to make it fair. Of any actual contract, \\nit can always\\nbe asked, “Is it fair, what they agreed to?” To answer this question, we can’t simply point to the\\nagreement itself; we need some independent standard of fairness.\\nWhere could such a standard come from? Perhaps, you might think, from a bigger, prior contract—a\\nconstitution, for example. But constitutions are open to the same challenge as other agreements. The\\nfact that a constitution is ratified by the people does not prove that its provisions are just. Consider the\\nU.S. Constitution of 1787. Despite its many virtues, it was marred by its acceptance of slavery, a defect\\nthat persisted until after the Civil War. The fact that the Constitution was agreed to—by the delegates in\\nPhiladelphia and then by the states—was not enough to make it just.\\nIt might be argued that this defect can be traced to a flaw in the consent. African American slaves\\nwere not included in the Constitutional Convention, nor were women, who didn’t win the right to vote until\\nmore than a century later. It is certainly possible that a more representative convention would have\\nproduced a more just constitution. But that is a matter of speculation. No actual social contract or\\nconstitutional convention, however representative, is guaranteed to produce fair terms of social\\ncooperation.\\nTo those who believe that morality begins and ends with consent, this may seem a jarring claim. But it\\nis not all that controversial. We often question the fairness of the deals people make. And we are\\nfamiliar with the contingencies that can lead to bad deals: one of the parties may be a better negotiator,\\nor have a stronger bargaining position, or know more about the value of the things being exchanged.\\nThe famous words of Don Corleone in \\nThe Godfather\\n, “I’m gonna make him an offer he can’t refuse,”\\nsuggest (in extreme form) the pressure that hovers, to some degree, over most negotiations.\\nTo recognize that contracts do not confer fairness on the terms they produce doesn’t mean we should\\nviolate our agreements whenever we please. We may be obligated to fulfill even an unfair bargain, at\\nleast up to a point. Consent matters, even if it’s not all there is to justice. But it is less decisive than we\\nsometimes think. We often confuse the moral work of consent with other sources of obligation.\\nSuppose we make a deal: You will bring me a hundred lobsters, and I will pay you $1,000. You\\nharvest and deliver the lobsters, I eat them and enjoy them, but refuse to pay. You say I owe you the\\nmoney. Why, I ask? You might point to our agreement, but you might also point to the benefit I’ve\\nenjoyed. You could very well say that I have an obligation to repay the benefit that, thanks to you, I’ve\\nenjoyed.\\nNow suppose we make the same deal, but this time, after you’ve gone to the work of catching the\\nlobsters and bringing them to my doorstep, I change my mind. I don’t want them after all. You still try to\\ncollect. I say, “I don’t owe you anything. This time, I haven’t benefited.” At this point, you might point to\\nour agreement, but you might also point to the hard work you’ve done to trap the lobsters while relying\\non the expectation that I would buy them. You could say I’m obligated to pay by virtue of the efforts\\nyou’ve made on my behalf.\\nNow let’s see if we can imagine a case where the obligation rests on consent alone—without the\\nadded moral weight of repaying a benefit or compensating you for the work you did on my behalf. This\\ntime, we make the same deal, but moments later, before you’ve spent any time gathering lobsters, I call\\nyou back and say, “I’ve changed my mind. I don’t want any lobsters.” Do I still owe you the $1,000? Do\\nyou say, “A deal is a deal,” and insist that my act of consent creates an obligation even without any\\nbenefit or reliance?\\nLegal thinkers have debated this question for a long time. Can consent create an obligation on itsown, or is some element of benefit or reliance also required?\\n3\\n This debate tells us something about the\\nmorality of contracts that we often overlook: actual contracts carry moral weight insofar as they realize\\ntwo ideals—autonomy and reciprocity.\\nAs voluntary acts, contracts express our autonomy; the obligations they create carry weight because\\nthey are self-imposed—we take them freely upon ourselves. As instruments of mutual benefit, contracts\\ndraw on the ideal of reciprocity; the obligation to fulfill them arises from the obligation to repay others for\\nthe benefits they provide us.\\nIn practice, these ideals—autonomy and reciprocity—are imperfectly realized. Some agreements,\\nthough voluntary, are not mutually beneficial. And sometimes we can be obligated to repay a benefit\\nsimply on grounds of reciprocity, even in the absence of a contract. This points to the moral limits of\\nconsent: In some cases, consent may not be enough to create a morally binding obligation; in others, it\\nmay not be necessary.\\nWhen Consent Is Not Enough: Baseball Cards and the Leaky Toilet\\nConsider two cases that show that consent alone is not enough: When my two sons were young, they\\ncollected baseball cards and traded them with each other. The older son knew more about the players\\nand the value of the cards. He sometimes offered his younger brother trades that were unfair—two\\nutility infielders, say, for Ken Griffey, Jr. So I instituted a rule that no trade was complete until I had\\napproved it. You may think this was paternalistic, which it was. (That’s what paternalism is for.) In\\ncircumstances like this one, voluntary exchanges can clearly be unfair.\\nSome years ago, I read a newspaper article about a more extreme case: An elderly widow in Chicago\\nhad a leaky toilet in her apartment. She hired a contractor to fix it—for $50,000. She signed a contract\\nthat required her to pay $25,000 as a down payment, and the remainder in installments. The scheme\\nwas discovered when she went to the bank to withdraw the $25,000. The teller asked why she needed\\nsuch a large withdrawal, and the woman replied that she had to pay the plumber. The teller contacted the\\npolice, who arrested the unscrupulous contractor for fraud.\\n4\\nAll but the most ardent contractarians would concede that the $50,000 toilet repair was egregiously\\nunfair—despite the fact that two willing parties agreed to it. This case illustrates two points about the\\nmoral limits of contracts: First, the fact of an agreement does not guarantee the fairness of the\\nagreement. Second, consent is not enough to create a binding moral claim. Far from an instrument of\\nmutual benefit, this contract mocks the ideal of reciprocity. This explains, I think, why few people would\\nsay that the elderly woman was morally obliged to pay the outrageous sum.\\nIt might be replied that the toilet repair scam was not a truly voluntary contract, but a kind of\\nexploitation, in which an unscrupulous plumber took advantage of an elderly woman who didn’t know any\\nbetter. I don’t know the details of the case, but let’s assume for the sake of argument that the plumber\\ndid not coerce the woman, and that she was of sound mind (though ill informed about the price of\\nplumbing) when she agreed to the deal. The fact that the agreement was voluntary by no means ensures\\nthat it involves the exchange of equal or comparable benefits.\\nI’ve argued so far that consent is not a sufficient condition of moral obligation; a lopsided deal may fall\\nso far short of mutual benefit that even its voluntary character can’t redeem it. I’d now like to offer a\\nfurther, more provocative claim: Consent is not a necessary condition of moral obligation. If the mutual\\nbenefit is clear enough, the moral claims of reciprocity may hold even without an act of consent.\\nWhen Consent Is Not Essential: Hume’s House and the Squeegee Men\\nThe kind of case I have in mind once confronted David Hume, the eighteenth-century Scottish moral\\nphilosopher. When he was young, Hume wrote a scathing critique of Locke’s idea of a social contract.\\nHe called it a “philosophical fiction which never had and never could have any reality,”\\n5\\n and “one of the\\nmost mysterious and incomprehensible operations that can possibly be imagined.”\\n6\\n Years later, Hume\\nhad an experience that put to the test his rejection of consent as the basis of obligation.\\n7\\nHume owned a house in Edinburgh. He rented it to his friend James Boswell, who in turn sublet it to aHume owned a house in Edinburgh. He rented it to his friend James Boswell, who in turn sublet it to a\\nsubtenant. The subtenant decided that the house needed some repairs. He hired a contractor to do the\\nwork, without consulting Hume. The contractor made the repairs and sent the bill to Hume. Hume refused\\nto pay on the grounds that he hadn’t consented. He hadn’t hired the contractor. The case went to court.\\nThe contractor acknowledged that Hume hadn’t consented. But the house needed the repairs, and he\\nperformed them.\\nHume thought this was a bad argument. The contractor’s claim was simply “that the work was\\nnecessary to be done,” Hume told the court. But this is “no good answer, because by the same rule he\\nmay go through every house in Edinburgh, and do what he thinks proper to be done, without the\\nlandlord’s consent . . . and give the same reason for what he did, that the work was necessary and that\\nthe house was the better of it.” But this, Hume maintained, was “a doctrine quite new and . . . altogether\\nuntenable.”\\n8\\nWhen it came to his house repairs, Hume didn’t like a purely benefit-based theory of obligation. But\\nhis defense failed, and the court ordered him to pay.\\nThe idea that an obligation to repay a benefit can arise without consent is morally plausible in the\\ncase of Hume’s house. But it can easily slide into high-pressure sales tactics and other abuses. In the\\n1980s and early ’90s, “squeegee men” became an intimidating presence on New York City streets.\\nEquipped with a squeegee and a bucket of water, they would descend upon a car stopped at a red light,\\nwash the windshield (often without asking the driver’s permission), and then ask for payment. They\\noperated on the benefit-based theory of obligation invoked by Hume’s contractor. But in the absence of\\nconsent, the line between performing a service and panhandling often blurred. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani\\ndecided to crack down on the squeegee men and ordered the police to arrest them.\\n9\\nBenefit or Consent? Sam’s Mobile Auto Repair\\nHere is another example of the confusion that can arise when the consent-based and benefit-based\\naspects of obligation are not clearly distinguished \\n. Many years ago, when I was a graduate student, I\\ndrove across the country with some friends. We stopped at a rest stop in Hammond, Indiana, and went\\ninto a convenience store. When we returned to our car, it wouldn’t start. None of us knew much about\\ncar repair. As we wondered what to do, a van pulled up beside us. On the side was a sign that said,\\n“Sam’s Mobile Repair Van.” Out of the van came a man, presumably Sam.\\nHe approached us and asked if he could help. “Here’s how I work,” he explained. “I charge fifty dollars\\nan hour. If I fix your car in five minutes, you will owe me fifty dollars. If I work on your car for an hour and\\ncan’t fix it, you will still owe me fifty dollars.”\\n“What are the odds you’ll be able to fix the car?” I asked. He didn’t answer me directly, but starting\\npoking around under the steering column. I was unsure what to do. I looked to my friends to see what\\nthey thought. After a short time, the man emerged from under the steering column and said, “Well,\\nthere’s nothing wrong with the ignition system, but you still have forty-five minutes left. Do you want me\\nto look under the hood?”\\n“Wait a minute,” I said. “I haven’t hired you. We haven’t made any agreement.” The man became very\\nangry and said, “Do you mean to say that if I had fixed your car just now while I was looking under the\\nsteering column you wouldn’t have paid me?”\\nI said, “That’s a different question.”\\nI didn’t go into the distinction between consent-based and benefit-based obligations. Somehow I don’t\\nthink it would have helped. But the contretemps with Sam the repairman highlights a common confusion\\nabout consent. Sam believed that if he had fixed my car while he was poking around, I would have owed\\nhim the fifty dollars. I agree. But the reason I would have owed him the money is that he would have\\nperformed a benefit—namely, fixing my car. He inferred that, because I would have owed him, I must\\n(implicitly) have agreed to hire him. But this inference is a mistake. It wrongly assumes that wherever\\nthere is \\nan obligation, there must have been an agreement—some act of consent. It overlooks the\\npossibility that obligation can arise without consent. If Sam had fixed my car, I would have owed him in\\nthe name of reciprocity. Simply thanking him and driving off would have been unfair. But this doesn’t\\nimply that I had hired him.\\nWhen I tell this story to my students, most agree that, under the circumstances, I didn’t owe Sam thefifty dollars. But many hold this view for reasons different from mine. They argue that, since I didn’t\\nexplicitly hire Sam, I owed him nothing—and would have owed him nothing even if he had fixed my car.\\nAny payment would have been an act of generosity—a gratuity, not a duty. So they come to my\\ndefense, not by embracing my expansive view of obligation, but by asserting a stringent view of\\nconsent.\\nDespite our tendency to read consent into every moral claim, it is hard to make sense of our moral\\nlives without acknowledging the independent weight of reciprocity. Consider a marriage contract.\\nSuppose I discover, after twenty years of faithfulness on my part, that my wife has been seeing another\\nman. I would have two different grounds for moral outrage. One invokes consent: “But we had an\\nagreement. You made a vow. You broke your promise.” The second would invoke reciprocity: “But I’ve\\nbeen so faithful for my part. Surely I deserve better than this. This is no way to repay my loyalty.” And\\nso on. The second complaint makes no reference to consent, and does not require it. It would be morally\\nplausible even if we never exchanged marital vows, but lived together as partners for all those years.\\nImagining the Perfect Contract\\nWhat do these various misadventures tell us about the morality of contracts? Contracts derive their\\nmoral force from two different ideals, autonomy and reciprocity. But most actual contracts fall short of\\nthese ideals. If I’m up against someone with a superior bargaining position, \\nmy agreement may not be\\nwholly voluntary, but pressured or, in the extreme case, coerced. If I’m negotiating with someone with\\ngreater knowledge of the things we are exchanging, the deal may not be mutually beneficial. In the\\nextreme case, I may be defrauded or deceived.\\nIn real life, persons are situated differently. This means that differences in bargaining power and\\nknowledge are always possible. And as long as this is true, the fact of an agreement does not, by itself,\\nguarantee the fairness of an agreement. This is why actual contracts are not self-sufficient moral\\ninstruments. It always makes sense to ask, “But is it fair, what they have agreed to?”\\nBut imagine a contract among parties who were equal in power and knowledge, rather than unequal;\\nwho were identically situated, not differently situated. And imagine that the object of this contract was\\nnot plumbing or any ordinary deal, but the principles to govern our lives together, to assign our rights and\\nduties as citizens. A contract like this, among parties like these, would leave no room for coercion or\\ndeception or other unfair advantages. Its terms would be just, whatever they were, by virtue of their\\nagreement alone.\\nIf you can imagine a contract like this, you have arrived at Rawls’s idea of a hypothetical agreement\\nin an initial situation of equality. The veil of ignorance ensures the equality of power and knowledge that\\nthe original position requires. By ensuring that no one knows his or her place in society, his strengths or\\nweaknesses, his values or ends, the veil of ignorance ensures that no one can take advantage, even\\nunwittingly, of a favorable bargaining position.\\nIf a knowledge of particulars is allowed, then the outcome is biased by arbitrary contingencies .\\n. . If the original position is to yield agreements that are just, the parties must be fairly situated\\nand treated equally as moral persons. The arbitrariness of the world must be corrected for by\\nadjusting the circumstances of the initial contract situation.\\n10\\nThe irony is that a hypothetical agreement behind a veil of ignorance is not a pale form of an actual\\ncontract and so a morally weaker thing; it’s a pure form of an actual contract, and so a morally more\\npowerful thing.\\nTwo Principles of Justice\\nSuppose Rawls is right: The way to think about justice is to ask what principles we would choose in an\\noriginal position of equality, behind a veil of ignorance. What principles would emerge?\\nAccording to Rawls, we wouldn’t choose utilitarianism. Behind the veil of ignorance, we don’t know\\nwhere we will wind up in society, but we do know that we will want to pursue our ends and be treatedwith respect. In case we turn out to be a member of an ethnic or religious minority, we don’t want to be\\noppressed, even if this gives pleasure to the majority. Once the veil of ignorance rises and real life\\nbegins, we don’t want to find ourselves as victims of religious persecution or racial discrimination. In\\norder to protect against these dangers, we would reject utilitarianism and agree to a principle of equal\\nbasic liberties for all citizens, including the right to liberty of conscience and freedom of thought. And we\\nwould insist that this principle take priority over attempts to maximize the general welfare. We would not\\nsacrifice our fundamental rights and liberties for social and economic benefits.\\nWhat principle would we choose to govern social and economic inequalities? To guard against the\\nrisk of finding ourselves in crushing poverty, we might at first thought favor an equal distribution of\\nincome and wealth. But then it would occur to us that we could do better, even for those on the bottom.\\nSuppose that by permitting certain inequalities, such as higher pay for doctors than for bus drivers, we\\ncould improve the situation of those who have the least—by increasing access to health care for the\\npoor. Allowing for this possibility, we would adopt what Rawls calls “the difference principle”: only those\\nsocial and \\neconomic inequalities are permitted that work to the benefit of the least advantaged members\\nof society.\\nExactly how egalitarian is the difference principle? It’s hard to say, because the effect of pay\\ndifferences depends on social and economic circumstances. Suppose higher pay for doctors led to\\nmore and better medical care in impoverished rural areas. In that case, the wage difference could be\\nconsistent with Rawls’s principle. But suppose paying doctors more had no impact on health services in\\nAppalachia, and simply produced more cosmetic surgeons in Beverly Hills. In that case, the wage\\ndifference would be hard to justify from Rawls’s point of view.\\nWhat about the big earnings of Michael Jordan or the vast fortune of Bill Gates? Could these\\ninequalities be consistent with the difference principle? Of course, Rawls’s theory is not meant to\\nassess the fairness of this or that person’s salary; it is concerned with the basic structure of society,\\nand the way it allocates rights and duties, income and wealth, power and opportunities. For Rawls, the\\nquestion to ask is whether Gates’s wealth arose as part of a system that, taken as a whole, works to\\nthe benefit of the least well off. For example, was it subject to a progressive tax system that taxed the\\nrich to provide for the health, education, and welfare of the poor? If so, and if this system made the poor\\nbetter off than they would have been under a more strictly equal arrangement, then such inequalities\\ncould be consistent with the difference principle.\\nSome people question whether the parties to the original position would choose the difference\\nprinciple. How does Rawls know that, behind the veil of ignorance, people wouldn’t be gamblers, willing\\nto take their chances on a highly unequal society in hopes of landing on top? Maybe some would even\\nopt for a feudal society, willing to risk being a landless serf in the hopes of being a king.\\nRawls doesn’t believe that people choosing principles to govern their fundamental life prospects would\\ntake such chances. Unless they knew themselves to be lovers of risk (a quality blocked from view by the\\nveil of ignorance), people would not make risky bets at high stakes. \\nBut Rawls’s case for the difference\\nprinciple doesn’t rest entirely on the assumption that people in the original position would be risk averse.\\nUnderlying the device of the veil of ignorance is a moral argument that can be presented independent of\\nthe thought experiment. Its main idea is that the distribution of income and opportunity should not be\\nbased on factors that are arbitrary from a moral point of view.\\nThe Argument from Moral Arbitrariness\\nRawls presents this argument by comparing several rival theories of justice, beginning with feudal\\naristocracy. These days, no one defends the justice of feudal aristocracies or caste systems. These\\nsystems are unfair, Rawls observes, because they distribute income, wealth, opportunity, and power\\naccording to the accident of birth. If you are born into nobility, you have rights and powers denied those\\nborn into serfdom. But the circumstances of your birth are no doing of yours. So it’s unjust to make your\\nlife prospects depend on this arbitrary fact.\\nMarket societies remedy this arbitrariness, at least to some degree. They open careers to those with\\nthe requisite talents and provide equality before the law. Citizens are assured equal basic liberties, and\\nthe distribution of income and wealth is determined by the free market. This system—a free market with\\nformal equality of opportunity—corresponds to the libertarian theory of justice. It represents animprovement over feudal and caste societies, since it rejects fixed hierarchies of birth. Legally, it allows\\neveryone to strive and to compete. In practice, however, opportunities may be far from equal.\\nThose who have supportive families and a good education have obvious advantages over those who\\ndo not. Allowing everyone to enter the race is a good thing. But if the runners start from different starting\\npoints, the race is hardly fair. That is why, Rawls argues, the distribution of income and wealth that\\nresults from a free market with formal equality of opportunity cannot be considered just. The most\\nobvious injustice of the libertarian system “is that it permits distributive shares \\nto be improperly\\ninfluenced by these factors so arbitrary from a moral point of view.”\\n11\\nOne way of remedying this unfairness is to correct for social and economic disadvantage. A fair\\nmeritocracy attempts to do so by going beyond merely formal equality of opportunity. It removes\\nobstacles to achievement by providing equal educational opportunities, so that those from poor families\\ncan compete on an equal basis with those from more privileged backgrounds. It institutes Head Start\\nprograms, childhood nutrition and health care programs, education and job training programs—whatever\\nis needed to bring everyone, regardless of class or family background, to the same starting point.\\nAccording to the meritocratic conception, the distribution of income and wealth that results from a free\\nmarket is just, but only if everyone has the same opportunity to develop his or her talents. Only if\\neveryone begins at the same starting line can it be said that the winners of the race deserve their\\nrewards.\\nRawls believes that the meritocratic conception corrects for certain morally arbitrary advantages, but\\nstill falls short of justice. For, even if you manage to bring everyone up to the same starting point, it is\\nmore or less predictable who will win the race—the fastest runners. But being a fast runner is not wholly\\nmy own doing. It is morally contingent in the same way that coming from an affluent family is contingent.\\n“Even if it works to perfection in eliminating the influence of social contingencies,” Rawls writes, the\\nmeritocratic system “still permits the distribution of wealth and income to be determined by the natural\\ndistribution of abilities and talents.”\\n12\\nIf Rawls is right, even a free market operating in a society with equal educational opportunities does\\nnot produce a just distribution of income and wealth. The reason: “Distributive shares are decided by the\\noutcome of the natural lottery; and this outcome is arbitrary from a moral perspective. There is no more\\nreason to permit the distribution of income and wealth to be settled by the distribution of natural assets\\nthan by historical and social fortune.”\\n13\\nRawls concludes that the meritocratic conception of justice is flawed for the same reason (though to a\\nlesser degree) as the libertarian conception; both base distributive shares on factors that are morally\\narbitrary. “Once we are troubled by the influence of either social contingencies or natural chance on the\\ndetermination of the distributive shares, we are bound, on reflection, to be bothered by the influence of\\nthe other. From a moral standpoint the two seem equally arbitrary.”\\n14\\nOnce we notice the moral arbitrariness that taints both libertarian and the meritocratic theories of\\njustice, Rawls argues, we can’t be satisfied short of a more egalitarian conception. But what could this\\nconception be? It is one thing to remedy unequal educational opportunities, but quite another to remedy\\nunequal native endowments. If we are bothered by the fact that some runners are faster than others,\\ndon’t we have to make the gifted runners wear lead shoes? Some critics of egalitarianism believe that\\nthe only alternative to a meritocratic market society is a leveling equality that imposes handicaps on the\\ntalented.\\nAn Egalitarian Nightmare\\n“Harrison Bergeron,” a short story by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., plays out this worry as dystopian science\\nfiction. “The year was 2081,” the story begins, “and everybody was finally equal . . . Nobody was\\nsmarter than anybody else. Nobody was better looking than anybody else. Nobody was stronger or\\nquicker than anybody else.” This thoroughgoing equality was enforced by agents of the United States\\nHandicapper General. Citizens of above average intelligence were required to wear mental handicap\\nradios in their ears. Every twenty seconds or so, a government transmitter would send out a sharp\\nnoise to prevent them “from taking unfair advantage of their brains.”\\n15\\nHarrison Bergeron, age fourteen, is unusually smart, handsome, and gifted, and so has to be fittedwith heavier handicaps than most. Instead of the little ear radio, “he wore a tremendous pair of\\nearphones, and spectacles with thick wavy lenses.” To disguise his good looks, \\nHarrison is required to\\nwear “a red rubber ball for a nose, keep his eyebrows shaved off, and cover his even white teeth with\\nblack caps at snaggle-tooth random.” And to offset his physical strength, he has to walk around wearing\\nheavy scrap metal. “In the race of life, Harrison carried three hundred pounds.”\\n16\\nOne day, Harrison sheds his handicaps in an act of heroic defiance against the egalitarian tyranny. I\\nwon’t spoil the story by revealing the conclusion. It should already be clear how Vonnegut’s story makes\\nvivid a familiar complaint against egalitarian theories of justice.\\nRawls’s theory of justice, however, is not open to that objection. He shows that a leveling equality is\\nnot the only alternative to a meritocratic market society. Rawls’s alternative, which he calls the\\ndifference principle, corrects for the unequal distribution of talents and endowments without\\nhandicapping the talented. How? Encourage the gifted to develop and exercise their talents, but with the\\nunderstanding that the rewards these talents reap in the market belong to the community as a whole.\\nDon’t handicap the best runners; let them run and do their best. Simply acknowledge in advance that the\\nwinnings don’t belong to them alone, but should be shared with those who lack similar gifts.\\nAlthough the difference principle does not require an equal distribution of income and wealth, its\\nunderlying idea expresses a powerful, even inspiring vision of equality:\\nThe difference principle represents, in effect, an agreement to regard the distribution of natural\\ntalents as a common asset and to share in the benefits of this distribution whatever it turns out\\nto be. Those who have been favored by nature, whoever they are, may gain from their good\\nfortune only on terms that improve the situation of those who have lost out. The naturally\\nadvantaged are not to gain merely because they are more gifted, but only to cover the costs of\\ntraining and education and for using their endowments in ways that help the less fortunate as\\nwell. No one deserves his greater natural capacity nor merits a more favorable starting place in\\nsociety. But it does not follow \\nthat one should eliminate these distinctions. There is another\\nway to deal with them. The basic structure of society can be arranged so that these\\ncontingencies work for the good of the least fortunate.\\n17\\nConsider, then, four rival theories of distribution justice:\\n \\n1. Feudal or caste system: fixed hierarchy based on birth.\\n2. Libertarian: free market with formal equality of opportunity.\\n3. Meritocratic: free market with fair equality of opportunity.\\n4. Egalitarian: Rawls’s difference principle.\\n \\nRawls argues that each of the first three theories bases distributive shares on factors that are\\narbitrary from a moral point of view—whether accident of birth, or social and economic advantage, or\\nnatural talents and abilities. Only the difference principle avoids basing the distribution of income and\\nwealth on these contingencies.\\nAlthough the argument from moral arbitrariness does not rely on the argument from the original\\nposition, it is similar in this respect: Both maintain that, in thinking about justice, we should abstract\\nfrom, or set aside, contingent facts about persons and their social positions.\\nObjection 1: Incentives\\nRawls’s case for the difference principle invites two main objections. First, what about incentives? If the\\ntalented can benefit from their talents only on terms that help the least well off, what if they decide to\\nwork less, or not to develop their skills in the first place? If tax rates are high or pay differentials small,\\nwon’t talented people who might have been surgeons go into less demanding lines of work? Won’t\\nMichael Jordan work less hard on his jump shot, or retire sooner than he otherwise might?\\nRawls’s reply is that the difference principle permits income inequalities for the sake of incentives,\\nprovided the incentives are needed \\nto improve the lot of the least advantaged. Paying CEOs more or\\ncutting taxes on the wealthy simply to increase the gross domestic product would not be enough. But ifthe incentives generate economic growth that makes those at the bottom better off than they would be\\nwith a more equal arrangement, then the difference principle permits them.\\nIt is important to notice that allowing wage differences for the sake of incentives is different from\\nsaying that the successful have a privileged moral claim to the fruits of their labor. If Rawls is right,\\nincome inequalities are just only insofar as they call forth efforts that ultimately help the disadvantaged,\\nnot because CEOs or sports stars deserve to make more money than factory workers.\\nObjection 2: Effort\\nThis brings us to a second, more challenging objection to Rawls’s theory of justice: What about effort?\\nRawls rejects the meritocratic theory of justice on the grounds that people’s natural talents are not their\\nown doing. But what about the hard work people devote to cultivating their talents? Bill Gates worked\\nlong and hard to develop Microsoft. Michael Jordan put in endless hours honing his basketball skills.\\nNotwithstanding their talents and gifts, don’t they deserve the rewards their efforts bring?\\nRawls replies that even effort may be the product of a favorable upbringing. “Even the willingness to\\nmake an effort, to try, and so to be deserving in the ordinary sense is itself dependent upon happy\\nfamily and social circumstances.”\\n18\\n Like other factors in our success, effort is influenced by\\ncontingencies for which we can claim no credit. “It seems clear that the effort a person is willing to make\\nis influenced by his natural abilities and skills and the alternatives open to him. The better endowed are\\nmore likely, other things equal, to strive conscientiously . . .”\\n19\\nWhen my students encounter Rawls’s argument about effort, many strenuously object. They argue\\nthat their achievements, including their \\nadmission to Harvard, reflect their own hard work, not morally\\narbitrary factors beyond their control. Many view with suspicion any theory of justice that suggests we\\ndon’t morally deserve the rewards our efforts bring.\\nAfter we debate Rawls’s claim about effort, I conduct an unscientific survey. I point out that\\npsychologists say that birth order has an influence on effort and striving—such as the effort the students\\nassociate with getting into Harvard. The first-born reportedly have a stronger work ethic, make more\\nmoney, and achieve more conventional success than their younger siblings. These studies are\\ncontroversial, and I don’t know if their findings are true. But just for the fun of it, I ask my students how\\nmany are first in birth order. About 75 to 80 percent raise their hands. The result has been the same\\nevery time I have taken the poll.\\nNo one claims that being first in birth order is one’s own doing. If something as morally arbitrary as\\nbirth order can influence our tendency to work hard and strive conscientiously, then Rawls may have a\\npoint. Even effort can’t be the basis of moral desert.\\nThe claim that people deserve the rewards that come from effort and hard work is questionable for a\\nfurther reason: although proponents of meritocracy often invoke the virtues of effort, they don’t really\\nbelieve that effort alone should be the basis of income and wealth. Consider two construction workers.\\nOne is strong and brawny, and can build four walls in a day without breaking a sweat. The other is weak\\nand scrawny, and can’t carry more than two bricks at a time. Although he works very hard, it takes him a\\nweek to do what his muscular co-worker achieves, more or less effortlessly, in a day. No defender of\\nmeritocracy would say the weak but hardworking worker deserves to be paid more, in virtue of his\\nsuperior effort, than the strong one.\\nOr consider Michael Jordan. It’s true, he practiced hard. But some lesser basketball players practice\\neven harder. No one would say they deserve a bigger contract than Jordan’s as a reward for all the\\nhours they put in. So, despite the talk about effort, it’s really contribution, or achievement, that the\\nmeritocrat believes is worthy of reward. Whether \\nor not our work ethic is our own doing, our contribution\\ndepends, at least in part, on natural talents for which we can claim no credit.\\nRejecting Moral Desert\\nIf Rawls’s argument about the moral arbitrariness of talents is right, it leads to a surprising conclusion:\\nDistributive justice is not a matter of rewarding moral desert.\\nHe recognizes that this conclusion is at odds with our ordinary way of thinking about justice: “There isa tendency for common sense to suppose that income and wealth, and the good things in life generally,\\nshould be distributed according to moral desert. Justice is happiness according to virtue . . . Now justice\\nas fairness rejects this conception.”\\n20\\nRawls undermines the meritocratic view by calling into question its basic premise, namely, that once\\nwe remove social and economic barriers to success, people can be said to deserve the rewards their\\ntalents bring:\\nWe do not deserve our place in the distribution of native endowments, any more than we\\ndeserve our initial starting point in society. That we deserve the superior character than\\nenables us to make the effort to cultivate our abilities is also problematic; for such character\\ndepends in good part upon fortunate family and social circumstances in early life for which can\\nclaim no credit. The notion of desert does not apply here.\\n21\\nIf distributive justice is not about rewarding moral desert, does this mean that people who work hard\\nand play by the rules have no claim whatsoever on the rewards they get for their efforts? No, not\\nexactly. Here Rawls makes an important but subtle distinction—between moral desert and what he calls\\n“entitlements to legitimate expectations.” The difference is this: Unlike a desert claim, an entitlement can\\narise only once certain rules of the game are in place. It can’t tell us how to set up the rules in the first\\nplace.\\nThe conflict between moral desert and entitlements underlies many of our most heated debates about\\njustice: Some say that increasing tax rates on the wealthy deprives them of something they morally\\ndeserve; or that considering racial and ethnic diversity as a factor in college admissions deprives\\napplicants with high SAT scores of an advantage they morally deserve. Others say no—people don’t\\nmorally deserve these advantages; we first have to decide what the rules of the game (the tax rates, the\\nadmissions criteria) should be. Only then can we say who is entitled to what.\\nConsider the difference between a game of chance and a game of skill. Suppose I play the state\\nlottery. If my number comes up, I am entitled to my winnings. But I can’t say that I deserved to win,\\nbecause a lottery is a game of chance. My winning or losing has nothing to do with my virtue or skill in\\nplaying the game.\\nNow imagine the Boston Red Sox winning the World Series. Having done so, they are entitled to the\\ntrophy. Whether or not they deserved to win would be a further question. The answer would depend on\\nhow they played the game. Did they win by a fluke (a bad call by the umpire at a decisive moment, for\\nexample) or because they actually played better than their opponents, displaying the excellences and\\nvirtues (good pitching, timely hitting, sparkling defense, etc.) that define baseball at its best?\\nWith a game of skill, unlike a game of chance, there can be a difference between who is entitled to\\nthe winnings and who deserved to win. This is because games of skill reward the exercise and display\\nof certain virtues.\\nRawls argues that distributive justice is not about rewarding virtue or moral desert. Instead, it’s about\\nmeeting the legitimate expectations that arise once the rules of the game are in place. Once the\\nprinciples of justice set the terms of social cooperation, people are entitled to the benefits they earn\\nunder the rules. But if the tax system requires them to hand over some portion of their income to help\\nthe disadvantaged, they can’t complain that this deprives them of something they morally deserve.\\nA just scheme, then, answers to what men are entitled to; it satisfies their legitimate\\nexpectations as founded upon social institutions. But what they are entitled to is not\\nproportional to nor dependent upon their intrinsic worth. The principles of justice that regulate\\nthe basic structure of society . . . do not mention moral desert, and there is no tendency for\\ndistributive shares to correspond to it.\\n22\\nRawls rejects moral desert as the basis for distributive justice on two grounds. First, as we’ve already\\nseen, my having the talents that enable me to compete more successfully than others is not entirely my\\nown doing. But a second contingency is equally decisive: the qualities that a society happens to value\\nat any given time also morally arbitrary. Even if I had sole, unproblematic claim to my talents, it would\\nstill be the case that the rewards these talents reap will depend on the contingencies of supply and\\ndemand. In medieval Tuscany, fresco painters were highly valued; in twenty-first-century California,computer programmers are, and so on. Whether my skills yield a lot or a little depends on what the\\nsociety happens to want. What counts as contributing depends on the qualities a given society happens\\nto prize.\\nConsider these wage differentials:\\n \\n• The average schoolteacher in the United States makes about $43,000 per year. David Letterman,\\nthe late-night talk show host, earns $31 million a year.\\n• John Roberts, chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, is paid $217,400 a year. Judge Judy, who\\nhas a reality television show, makes $25 million a year.\\n \\nAre these pay differentials fair? The answer, for Rawls, would depend on whether they arose within a\\nsystem of taxation and redistribution that worked to the benefit of the least well off. If so, Letterman and\\nJudge Judy would be entitled to their earnings. But it can’t be said \\nthat Judge Judy deserves to make\\none hundred times more than Chief Justice Roberts, or that Letterman deserves to make seven hundred\\ntimes as much as a schoolteacher. The fact that they happen to live in a society that lavishes huge\\nsums on television stars is their good luck, not something they deserve.\\nThe successful often overlook this contingent aspect of their success. Many of us are fortunate to\\npossess, at least in some measure, the qualities our society happens to prize. In a capitalist society, it\\nhelps to have entrepreneurial drive. In a bureaucratic society, it helps to get on easily and smoothly with\\nsuperiors. In a mass democratic society, it helps to look good on television, and to speak in short,\\nsuperficial sound bites. In a litigious society, it helps to go to law school, and to have the logical and\\nreasoning skills that will allow you to score well on the LSATs.\\nThat our society values these things is not our doing. Suppose that we, with our talents, inhabited not\\na technologically advanced, highly litigious society like ours, but a hunting society, or a warrior society,\\nor a society that conferred its highest rewards and prestige on those who displayed physical strength,\\nor religious piety. What would become of our talents then? Clearly, they wouldn’t get us very far. And no\\ndoubt some of us would develop others. But would we be less worthy or less virtuous than we are now?\\nRawls’s answer is no. We might receive less, and properly so. But while we would be entitled to less,\\nwe would be no less worthy, no less deserving than others. The same is true of those in our society\\nwho lack prestigious positions, and who possess fewer of the talents that our society happens to\\nreward.\\nSo, while we are entitled to the benefits that the rules of the game promise for the exercise of our\\ntalents, it is a mistake and a conceit to suppose that we deserve in the first place a society that values\\nthe qualities we have in abundance.\\nWoody Allen makes a similar point in his movie \\nStardust Memories\\n. \\nAllen, playing a character akin to\\nhimself, a celebrity comedian named Sandy, meets up with Jerry, a friend from his old neighborhood who\\nis chagrined at being a taxi driver.\\n \\nSANDY:\\n So what are you doing? What are you up to?\\nJERRY:\\n You know what I do? I drive a cab.\\nSANDY:\\n Well, you look good. You—There’s nothing wrong with that.\\nJERRY:\\n Yeah. But look at me compared to you . . .\\nSANDY:\\n What do you want me to say? I was the kid in the neighborhood who told the jokes, right?\\nJERRY:\\n Yeah.\\nSANDY:\\n So, so—we, you know, we live in a—in a society that puts a big value on jokes, you know?\\nIf you think of it this way—(\\nclearing his throat\\n) if I had been an Apache Indian, those guys didn’t\\nneed comedians at all, right? So I’d be out of work.\\nJERRY:\\n So? Oh, come on, that doesn’t help me feel any better.\\n23\\n \\nThe taxi driver was not moved by the comedian’s riff on the moral arbitrariness of fame and fortune.\\nViewing his meager lot as a matter of bad luck didn’t lessen the sting. Perhaps that’s because, in a\\nmeritocratic society, most people think that worldly success reflects what we deserve; the idea is not\\neasy to dislodge. Whether distributive justice can be detached altogether from moral desert is a\\nquestion we explore in the pages to come.Is Life Unfair?\\nIn 1980, as Ronald Reagan ran for president, the economist Milton Friedman published a bestselling\\nbook, co-authored with his wife, Rose, called \\nFree to Choose\\n. It was a spirited, unapologetic defense of\\nthe free-market economy, and it became a textbook—even an anthem—for the Reagan years. In\\ndefending laissez-faire principles against egalitarian objections, Friedman made a surprising\\nconcession. He acknowledged that \\nthose who grow up in wealthy families and attend elite schools have\\nan unfair advantage over those from less privileged backgrounds. He also conceded that those who,\\nthrough no doing of their own, inherit talents and gifts have an unfair advantage over others. Unlike\\nRawls, however, Friedman insisted that we should not try to remedy this unfairness. Instead, we should\\nlearn to live with it, and enjoy the benefits it brings:\\nLife is not fair. It is tempting to believe that government can rectify what nature has spawned.\\nBut it is also important to recognize how much we benefit from the very unfairness we deplore.\\nThere’s nothing fair . . . about Muhammad Ali’s having been born with the skill that made him a\\ngreat fighter . . . It is certainly not fair that Muhammad Ali should be able to earn millions of\\ndollars in one night. But wouldn’t it have been even more unfair to the people who enjoyed\\nwatching him if, in the pursuit of some abstract ideal of equality, Muhammad Ali had not been\\npermitted to earn more for one night’s fight . . . than the lowest man on the totem pole could get\\nfor a day’s unskilled work on the docks?\\n24\\nIn \\nA Theory of Justice\\n, Rawls rejects the counsel of complacence that Friedman’s view reflects. In a\\nstirring passage, Rawls states a familiar truth that we often forget: The way things are does not\\ndetermine the way they ought to be.\\nWe should reject the contention that the ordering of institutions is always defective because\\nthe distribution of natural talents and the contingencies of social circumstance are unjust, and\\nthis injustice must inevitably carry over to human arrangements. Occasionally this reflection is\\noffered as an excuse for ignoring injustice, as if the refusal to acquiesce in injustice is on a par\\nwith being unable to accept death. The natural distribution is neither just nor unjust; nor is it\\nunjust that persons are born into society at some particular position. These are \\nsimply natural\\nfacts. What is just and unjust is the way that institutions deal with these facts.\\n25\\nRawls proposes that we deal with these facts by agreeing “to share one another’s fate,” and “to avail\\n[ourselves] of the accidents of nature and social circumstance only when doing so is for the common\\nbenefit.”\\n26\\n Whether or not his theory of justice ultimately succeeds, it represents the most compelling\\ncase for a more equal society that American political philosophy has yet produced.7. ARGUING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION\\nCheryl Hopwood\\n did not come from an affluent family. Raised by a single mother, she worked her way\\nthrough high school, community college, and California State University at Sacramento. She then moved\\nto Texas and applied to the University of Texas Law School, the best law school in the state and one of\\nthe leading law schools in the country. Although Hopwood had compiled a grade point average of 3.8\\nand did reasonably well on the law school admissions test (scoring in the 83rd percentile), she was not\\nadmitted.\\n1\\nHopwood, who is white, thought her rejection was unfair. Some of the applicants admitted instead of\\nher were African American and Mexican American students who had lower college grades and test\\nscores than she did. The school had an affirmative action policy that gave preference to minority\\napplicants. In fact, all of the minority students with grades and test scores comparable to Hopwood’s\\nhad been admitted.\\nHopwood took her case to federal court, arguing that she was a victim of discrimination. The\\nuniversity replied that part of the law school’s mission was to increase the racial and ethnic diversity of\\nthe Texas legal profession, including not only law firms, but also the state legislature and the courts.\\n“Law in a civil society depends overwhelmingly \\non the willingness of society to accept its judgment,”\\nsaid Michael Sharlot, dean of the law school. “It becomes harder to achieve that if we don’t see\\nmembers of all groups playing roles in the administration of justice.”\\n2\\n In Texas, African Americans and\\nMexican Americans comprise 40 percent of the population, but a far smaller proportion of the legal\\nprofession. When Hopwood applied, the University of Texas law school used an affirmative action\\nadmissions policy that aimed at enrolling about 15 percent of the class from among minority applicants.\\n3\\nIn order to achieve this goal, the university set lower admissions standards for minority applicants\\nthan for nonminority applicants. University officials argued, however, that all of the minority students\\nwho were admitted were qualified to do the work, and almost all succeed in graduating from law school\\nand passing the bar exam. But that was small comfort to Hopwood, who believed she’d been treated\\nunfairly, and should have been admitted.\\n \\nHopwood’s challenge to affirmative action was not the first to find its way to court, nor would it be the\\nlast. For over three decades, the courts have wrestled with the hard moral and legal questions posed by\\naffirmative action. In 1978, in the \\nBakke\\n case, the U.S. Supreme Court narrowly upheld an affirmative\\naction admissions policy of the medical school at University of California at Davis.\\n4\\n In 2003, a closely\\ndivided Supreme Court ruled that race could be used as a factor in admissions in a case involving the\\nUniversity of Michigan Law School.\\n5\\n Meanwhile, voters in California, Washington, and Michigan have\\nrecently enacted ballot initiatives to ban racial preferences in public education and employment.\\nThe question for the courts is whether affirmative action hiring and admissions policies violate the\\nU.S. Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection of the laws. But let’s set aside the constitutional\\nquestion and focus directly on the moral question: Is it unjust to consider race and ethnicity as factors in\\nhiring or university admissions?\\nTo answer this question, let’s consider three reasons that proponents of affirmative action offer for\\ntaking race and ethnicity into account: correcting for bias in standardized tests, compensating for past\\nwrongs, and promoting diversity.\\nCorrecting for the Testing Gap\\nOne reason for taking race and ethnicity into account is to correct for possible bias in standardized\\ntests. The ability of the SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) and other such tests to predict academic and\\ncareer success has long been disputed. In 1951, an applicant to the doctoral program in the School of\\nReligion at Boston University presented mediocre scores on the GRE (Graduate Record Exam). Theyoung Martin Luther King, Jr., who would become one of the greatest orators in American history,\\nscored below average in verbal aptitude.\\n6\\n Fortunately, he was admitted anyway.\\nSome studies show that black and Hispanic students on the whole score lower than white students on\\nstandardized tests, even adjusting for economic class. But whatever the cause of the testing gap, using\\nstandardized tests to predict academic success requires interpreting the scores in light of students’\\nfamily, social, cultural, and educational backgrounds. A 700 SAT score from a student who attended\\npoor public schools in the South Bronx means more than the same score for a graduate of an elite\\nprivate school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. But assessing test scores in light of students’\\nracial, ethnic, and economic backgrounds does not challenge the notion that colleges and universities\\nshould admit those students with the greatest academic promise; it is simply an attempt to find the most\\naccurate measure of each individual’s academic promise.\\n \\n________\\n \\nThe real affirmative action debate is about two other rationales—the compensatory argument and the\\ndiversity argument.\\nCompensating for Past Wrongs\\nThe compensatory argument views affirmative action as a remedy for past wrongs. It says minority\\nstudents should be given preference to make up for a history of discrimination that has placed them at\\nan unfair disadvantage. This argument treats admission primarily as a benefit to the recipient and seeks\\nto distribute the benefit in a way that compensates for past injustice and its lingering effects.\\nBut the compensatory argument runs into a tough challenge: critics point out that those who benefit\\nare not necessarily those who have suffered, and those who pay the compensation are seldom those\\nresponsible for the wrongs being rectified. Many beneficiaries of affirmative action are middle-class\\nminority students who did not suffer the hardships that afflict young African Americans and Hispanics\\nfrom the inner city. Why should an African American student from an affluent Houston suburb get an\\nedge over Cheryl Hopwood, who may actually have faced a tougher economic struggle?\\nIf the point is to help the disadvantaged, critics argue, affirmative action should be based on class,\\nnot race. And if racial preferences are intended to compensate for the historic injustice of slavery and\\nsegregation, how can it be fair to exact that compensation from people such as Hopwood, who played\\nno part in perpetrating the injustice?\\nWhether the compensatory case for affirmative action can answer this objection depends on the\\ndifficult concept of collective responsibility: Can we ever have a moral responsibility to redress wrongs\\ncommitted by a previous generation? To answer this question, we need to know more about how moral\\nobligations arise. Do we incur obligations \\nonly as individuals, or do some obligations claim us as\\nmembers of communities with historic identities? Since we will come to this question later in the book,\\nlet’s set it aside for the moment and turn to the diversity argument.\\nPromoting Diversity\\nThe diversity argument for affirmative action does not depend on controversial notions of collective\\nresponsibility. Nor does it depend on showing that the minority student given preference in admission\\nhas personally suffered discrimination or disadvantage. It treats admission less as a reward to the\\nrecipient than as a means of advancing a socially worthy aim.\\nThe diversity rationale is an argument in the name of the common good—the common good of the\\nschool itself and also of the wider society. First, it holds that a racially mixed student body is desirable\\nbecause it enables students to learn more from one another than they would if all of them came from\\nsimilar backgrounds. Just as a student body drawn from one part of the country would limit the range of\\nintellectual and cultural perspectives, so would one that reflected homogeneity of race, ethnicity, and\\nclass. Second, the diversity argument maintains that equipping disadvantaged minorities to assume\\npositions of leadership in key public and professional roles advances the university’s civic purpose andcontributes to the common good.\\nThe diversity argument is the one most frequently advanced by colleges and universities. When faced\\nwith Hopwood’s challenge, the dean of the University of Texas Law School cited the civic purpose\\nserved by his school’s affirmative action policy. Part of the law school’s mission was to help increase\\nthe diversity of the Texas legal profession and to enable African Americans and Hispanics to assume\\nleadership roles in government and law. By this measure, he said, the law school’s affirmative action\\nprogram was a success: “We see minority graduates of \\nours as elected officials, working in prominent\\nlaw firms, as members of the Texas legislature and the federal bench. To the extent that there are\\nminorities in important offices in Texas, they are often our graduates.”\\n7\\n \\nWhen the U.S. Supreme Court heard the \\nBakke\\n case, Harvard College submitted a friend-of-the-court\\nbrief defending affirmative action on educational grounds.\\n8\\n It stated that grades and test scores had\\nnever been the only standard of admission. “If scholarly excellence were the sole or even predominant\\ncriterion, Harvard College would lose a great deal of its vitality and intellectual excellence . . . [T]he\\nquality of the educational experience offered to all students would suffer.” In the past, diversity had\\nmeant “students from California, New York, and Massachusetts; city dwellers and farm boys; violinists,\\npainters and football players; biologists, historians and classicists; potential stockbrokers, academics\\nand politicians.” Now, the college also cared about racial and ethnic diversity.\\nA farm boy from Idaho can bring something to Harvard College that a Bostonian cannot offer.\\nSimilarly, a black student can usually bring something that a white student cannot offer. The\\nquality of the educational experience of all the students in Harvard College depends in part on\\nthese differences in the background and outlook that students bring with them.\\n9\\nCritics of the diversity argument offer two kinds of objection—one practical, the other principled. The\\npractical objection questions the effectiveness of affirmative action policies. It argues that the use of\\nracial preferences will not bring about a more pluralistic society or reduce prejudice and inequalities but\\nwill damage the self-esteem of minority students, increase racial consciousness on all sides, heighten\\nracial tensions, and provoke resentment among white ethnic groups who feel they, too, should get a\\nbreak. The practical objection does not \\nclaim that affirmative action is unjust, but rather that it is unlikely\\nto achieve its aims, and may do more harm than good.\\nDo Racial Preferences Violate Rights?\\nThe principled objection claims that, however worthy the goal of a more diverse classroom or a more\\nequal society, and however successful affirmative action policies may be in achieving it, using race or\\nethnicity as a factor in admissions is unfair. The reason: doing so violates the rights of applicants such\\nas Cheryl Hopwood, who, through no fault of their own, are put at a competitive disadvantage.\\nFor a utilitarian, this objection would not carry much weight. The case for affirmative action would\\nsimply depend on weighing the educational and civic benefits it produces against the disappointment it\\ncauses Hopwood and other white applicants at the margin who lose out. But many proponents of\\naffirmative action are not utilitarians; they are Kantian or Rawlsian liberals who believe that even\\ndesirable ends must not override individual rights. For them, if using race as a factor in admissions\\nviolates Hopwood’s rights, then doing so is unjust.\\nRonald Dworkin, a rights-oriented legal philosopher, addresses this objection by arguing that the use\\nof race in affirmative action policies doesn’t violate anybody’s rights.\\n10\\n What right, he asks, has\\nHopwood been denied? Perhaps she believes that people have a right not to be judged according to\\nfactors, such as race, that are beyond their control. But most traditional criteria for university admission\\ninvolve factors beyond one’s control. It’s not my fault that I come from Massachusetts rather than Idaho,\\nor that I’m a lousy football player, or that I can’t carry a tune. Nor is it my fault if I lack the aptitude to do\\nwell on the SAT.\\nPerhaps the right at stake is the right to be considered according to academic criteria alone—notbeing good at football, or coming from Idaho, or having volunteered in a soup kitchen. On this view, if my\\ngrades, test scores, and other measures of academic promise land me \\nin the top group of applicants,\\nthen I deserve to be admitted. I deserve, in other words, to be considered according to my academic\\nmerit alone.\\nBut as Dworkin points out, there is no such right. Some universities may admit students solely on the\\nbasis of academic qualifications, but most do not. Universities define their missions in various ways.\\nDworkin argues that no applicant has a right that the university define its mission and design its\\nadmissions policy in a way that prizes above all any particular set of qualities—whether academic skills,\\nathletic abilities, or anything else. Once the university defines its mission and sets its admissions\\nstandards, you have a legitimate expectation to admission insofar as you meet those standards better\\nthan other applicants. Those who finish in the top group of candidates—counting academic promise,\\nethnic and geographical diversity, athletic prowess, extracurricular activities, community service, and so\\non—are entitled to be admitted; it would be unfair to exclude them. But no one has a right to be\\nconsidered according to any particular set of criteria in the first place.\\n11\\nHere lies the deep though contested claim at the heart of the diversity argument for affirmative action:\\nAdmission is not an honor bestowed to reward superior merit or virtue. Neither the student with high test\\nscores nor the student who comes from a disadvantaged minority group morally deserves to be\\nadmitted. Her Admission is justified insofar as it contributes to the social purpose the university serves,\\nnot because it rewards the student for her merit or virtue, independently defined. Dworkin’s point is that\\njustice in admissions is not a matter of rewarding merit or virtue; we can know what counts as a fair way\\nof allocating seats in the freshman class only once the university defines its mission. The mission\\ndefines the relevant merits, not the other way around. Dworkin’s account of justice in university\\nadmissions runs parallel to Rawls’s account of justice in income distribution: It is not a matter of moral\\ndesert.\\nRacial Segregation and Anti-Jewish Quotas\\nDoes this mean that colleges and universities are free to define their missions however they please,\\nand that any admissions policy that fits the declared mission is fair? If so, what about the racially\\nsegregated campuses of the American South not long ago? As it happens, the University of Texas Law\\nSchool had been at the center of an earlier constitutional challenge. In 1946, when the school was\\nsegregated, it denied admission to Heman Marion Sweatt on the grounds that the school did not admit\\nblacks. His challenge led to a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case, \\nSweatt v. Painter\\n (1950), which dealt\\na blow to segregation in higher education.\\nBut if the only test of the fairness of an admissions policy is its fit with the school’s mission, then what\\nwas wrong with the argument the Texas Law School presented at the time? Its mission was to train\\nlawyers for Texas law firms. Since Texas law firms did not hire blacks, the law school argued, its\\nmission would not be served by admitting them.\\nYou might argue that the University of Texas Law School, as a public institution, is constrained in its\\nchoice of mission to a greater extent than private universities. It is certainly true that the notable\\nconstitutional challenges to affirmative action in higher education have involved state universities—the\\nUniversity of California at Davis (in the \\nBakke\\n case), the University of Texas (\\nHopwood\\n), and the\\nUniversity of Michigan (\\nGrutter\\n). But since we are trying to determine the justice or injustice of using\\nrace—not its legality—the distinction between public and private universities is not decisive.\\nPrivate associations as well as public institutions can be criticized for injustice. Recall the sit-ins at\\nlunch counters protesting racial discrimination in the segregated American South. The lunch counters\\nwere privately owned, but the racial discrimination they practiced was unjust nonetheless. (In fact, the\\n1964 Civil Rights Act made such discrimination illegal.)\\nOr consider the anti-Jewish quotas employed, formally or informally, by some Ivy League universities\\nin the 1920s and ’30s. Were these quotas morally defensible simply because the universities were\\nprivate, not public? In 1922, Harvard’s president, A. Lawrence Lowell, proposed a 12 percent limit on\\nJewish enrollment, in the name of reducing anti-Semitism. “The anti-Semitic feeling among students is\\nincreasing,” he said, “and it grows in proportion to the increase in the number of Jews.”\\n12\\n In the 1930s,the director of admissions at Dartmouth wrote to an alumnus who had complained about the growing\\nnumber of Jews on campus. “I am glad to have your comments on the Jewish problem,” the official\\nwrote. “If we go beyond the 5 per cent or 6 per cent in the Class of 1938, I shall be grieved beyond\\nwords.” In 1945, the president of Dartmouth justified limits on Jewish enrollment by invoking the mission\\nof the school: “Dartmouth is a Christian College founded for the Christianization of its students.”\\n13\\nIf, as the diversity rationale for affirmative action assumes, universities may set any admissions\\ncriteria that advance their mission as they define it, is it possible to condemn racist exclusion and anti-\\nSemitic restrictions? Is there a principled distinction between the use of race to exclude people in the\\nsegregationist South and the use of race to include people in present-day affirmative action? The most\\nobvious answer is that, in its segregationist days, the Texas law school used race as a badge of\\ninferiority, whereas today’s racial preferences do not insult or stigmatize anyone. Hopwood considered\\nher rejection unfair, but she cannot claim that it expresses hatred or contempt.\\nThis is Dworkin’s answer. Segregation-era racial exclusion depended on “the despicable idea that one\\nrace may be inherently more worthy than another,” whereas affirmative action involves no such\\nprejudice. It simply asserts that, given the importance of promoting diversity in key professions, being\\nblack or Hispanic “may be a socially useful trait.”\\n14\\nRejected applicants such as Hopwood might not find this distinction satisfying, but it does have a\\ncertain moral force. The law school is \\nnot saying that Hopwood is inferior or that the minority students\\nadmitted instead of her deserve an advantage that she does not. It is simply saying that racial and\\nethnic diversity in the classroom and the courtroom serves the law school’s educational purposes. And\\nunless the pursuit of those purposes somehow violates the rights of those who lose out, disappointed\\napplicants can’t legitimately claim that they’ve been treated unfairly.\\nAffirmative Action for Whites?\\nHere is a test for the diversity argument: Can it sometimes justify racial preferences for whites?\\nConsider the case of Starrett City. This apartment complex in Brooklyn, New York, with twenty thousand\\nresidents, is the largest federally subsidized middle-income housing project in the United States. It\\nopened in the mid-1970s, with the goal of being a racially integrated community. It achieved this goal\\nthrough the use of “occupancy controls” that sought to balance the ethnic and racial composition of the\\ncommunity, limiting the African American and Hispanic population to about 40 percent of the total. In\\nshort, it used a quota system. The quotas were based not on prejudice or contempt, but on a theory\\nabout racial “tipping points” drawn from the urban experience. The managers of the project wanted to\\navoid the tipping point that had triggered “white flight” in other neighborhoods and undermined\\nintegration. By maintaining racial and ethnic balance, they hoped to sustain a stable, racially diverse\\ncommunity.\\n15\\nIt worked. The community became highly desirable, many families wanted to move in, and Starrett City\\nestablished a waiting list. Due in part to the quota system, which allocated fewer apartments for African\\nAmericans than for whites, black families had to wait longer than white families. By the mid-1980s, a\\nwhite family had to wait three to four months for an apartment, while a black family had to wait as long\\nas two years.\\nHere, then, was a quota system favoring white applicants—based \\nnot on racial prejudice but on the\\ngoal of sustaining an integrated community. Some black applicants found the race-conscious policy\\nunfair, and filed a discrimination suit. The NAACP, which favored affirmative action in other contexts,\\nrepresented them. In the end, a settlement was reached that allowed Starrett City to keep its quota\\nsystem but required the state to expand minority access to other housing projects.\\nWas Starrett City’s race-conscious way of allocating apartments unjust? No, not if you accept the\\ndiversity rationale for affirmative action. Racial and ethnic diversity play out differently in housing\\nprojects and college classrooms, and the goods at stake are not the same. But from the standpoint of\\nfairness, the two cases stand or fall together. If diversity serves the common good, and if no one is\\ndiscriminated against based on hatred or contempt, then racial preferences do not violate anyone’s\\nrights. Why not? Because, following Rawls’s point about moral desert, no one deserves to be\\nconsidered for an apartment or a seat in the freshman class according to his or her merits,independently defined. What counts as merit can be determined only once the housing authority or the\\ncollege officials define their mission.\\nCan Justice Be Detached from Moral Desert?\\nThe renunciation of moral desert as the basis of distributive justice is morally attractive but also\\ndisquieting. It’s attractive because it undermines the smug assumption, familiar in meritocratic societies,\\nthat success is the crown of virtue, that the rich are rich because they are more deserving than the\\npoor. As Rawls reminds us, “no one deserves his greater natural capacity nor merits a more favorable\\nstarting place in society.” Nor is it our doing that we live in a society that happens to prize our particular\\nstrengths. That is a measure of our good fortune, not our virtue.\\nWhat’s disquieting about severing justice from moral desert is less easy to describe. The belief that\\njobs and opportunities are rewards for \\nthose who deserve them runs deep, perhaps more so in the\\nUnited States than in other societies. Politicians constantly proclaim that those who “work hard and play\\nby the rules” deserve to get ahead, and encourage people who realize the American dream to view their\\nsuccess as a reflection of their virtue. This conviction is at best a mixed blessing. Its persistence is an\\nobstacle to social solidarity; the more we regard our success as our own doing, the less responsibility\\nwe feel for those who fall behind.\\nIt may be that this persisting belief—that success should be seen as a reward for virtue—is simply a\\nmistake, a myth whose hold we should try to dissolve. Rawls’s point about the moral arbitrariness of\\nfortune puts it powerfully in doubt. And yet it may not be possible, politically or philosophically, to detach\\narguments about justice from debates about desert as decisively as Rawls and Dworkin suggest. Let me\\ntry to explain why.\\nFirst, justice often has an honorific aspect. Debates about distributive justice are about not only who\\ngets what but also what qualities are worthy of honor and reward. Second, the idea that merit arises\\nonly once social institutions define their mission is subject to a complication: the social institutions that\\nfigure most prominently in debates about justice—schools, universities, occupations, professions, public\\noffices—are not free to define their mission just any way they please. These institutions are defined, at\\nleast in part, by the distinctive goods they promote. While there is room for argument about what, at any\\nmoment, the mission of a law school or an army or an orchestra should be, it’s not the case that just\\nanything goes. Certain goods are appropriate to certain social institutions, and to ignore these goods in\\nallocating roles can be a kind of corruption.\\nWe can see the way justice is entangled with honor by recalling Hopwood’s case. Suppose Dworkin\\nis right that moral desert has nothing to do with who should be admitted. Here is the letter of rejection\\nthe law school should have sent Hopwood:\\n16\\nDear Ms. Hopwood\\n,\\nWe regret to inform you that your application for admission has been rejected. Please\\nunderstand that we intend no offense by our decision. We do not hold you in contempt. In\\nfact, we don’t even regard you as less deserving than those who were admitted\\n.\\nIt is not your fault that when you came along society happened not to need the qualities you\\nhad to offer. Those admitted instead of you are not deserving of a place, nor worthy of praise\\nfor the factors that led to their admission. We are only using them—and you—as instruments\\nof a wider social purpose\\n.\\nWe realize you will find this news disappointing. But your disappointment should not be\\nexaggerated by the thought that this rejection reflects in any way on your intrinsic moral\\nworth. You have our sympathy in the sense that it is too bad you did not happen to have the\\ntraits society happened to want when you applied. Better luck next time\\n.\\nSincerely yours . . \\n.\\nAnd here is the letter of acceptance, shorn of honorific implications, that a philosophically frank law\\nschool should send those it admits:\\nDear successful applicant\\n,We are pleased to inform you that your application for admission has been accepted. It\\nturns out that you happen to have the traits that society needs at the moment, so we propose\\nto exploit your assets for society’s advantage by admitting you to the study of law\\n.\\nYou are to be congratulated, not in the sense that you deserve credit for having the\\nqualities that led to your admission—you do not—but only in the sense that the winner of a\\nlottery is to be congratulated. You are lucky to have come along with the right traits at the right\\nmoment. If you choose to accept our offer, you will ultimately be entitled to the benefits that\\nattach to being used in this way. For this, you may properly celebrate\\n.\\nYou, or more likely your parents, may be tempted to celebrate in the further sense that you\\ntake this admission to reflect favorably, if not on your native endowments, then at least on the\\nconscientious effort you have made to cultivate your abilities. But the notion that you deserve\\neven the superior character necessary to your effort is equally problematic, for your character\\ndepends on fortunate circumstances of various kinds for which you can claim no credit. The\\nnotion of desert does not apply here\\n.\\nWe look forward nonetheless to seeing you in the fall\\n.\\nSincerely yours . . \\n.\\nSuch letters might lessen the sting for those who are rejected, and dampen the hubris of those who\\nare accepted. So why do colleges continue to send (and applicants to expect) letters replete with\\ncongratulatory, honorific rhetoric? Perhaps because colleges can’t entirely dispense with the idea that\\ntheir role is not only to advance certain ends but also to honor and reward certain virtues.\\nWhy Not Auction College Admission?\\nThis leads us to the second question, about whether colleges and universities may define their mission\\nhowever they please. Put ethnic and racial preferences aside for the moment and consider another\\naffirmative action controversy—the debate over “legacy preferences.” Many colleges give children of\\nalumni an edge in admission. One rationale for doing so is to build community and school spirit over\\ntime. Another is the hope that grateful alumni parents will provide their alma mater with generous\\nfinancial support.\\nIn order to isolate the financial rationale, consider what universities call “development admits”—\\napplicants who are not children of alumni but who have wealthy parents able to make a sizeable financial\\ncontribution to the school. Many universities admit such students even if their grades and test scores\\nare not as high as would otherwise be required. \\nTo take this idea to the extreme, imagine that a\\nuniversity decided to auction 10 percent of the seats in the freshman class to the highest bidders.\\nWould this system of admission be fair? If you believe that \\nmerit\\n simply means the ability to\\ncontribute, in one way or another, to the mission of the university, the answer may be yes. Whatever\\ntheir mission, all universities need money to achieve it.\\nBy Dworkin’s expansive definition of merit, a student admitted to a school for the sake of a $10 million\\ngift for the new campus library is meritorious; her admission serves the good of the university as a\\nwhole. Students rejected in favor of the philanthropist’s child might complain they’ve been treated\\nunfairly. But Dworkin’s reply to Hopwood applies equally to them. All fairness requires is that no one be\\nrejected out of prejudice or contempt, and that applicants be judged by criteria related to the mission the\\nuniversity sets for itself. In this case, those conditions are met. The students who lose out aren’t the\\nvictims of prejudice; it’s just their bad luck to lack parents willing and able to donate a new library.\\nBut this standard is too weak. It still seems unfair for wealthy parents to be able to buy their child a\\nticket to the Ivy League. But what does the injustice consist in? It can’t be the fact that applicants from\\npoor or middle-class families are put at a disadvantage beyond their control. As Dworkin points out,\\nmany factors beyond our control are legitimate factors in admission.\\nPerhaps what’s troubling about the auction has less to do with the opportunity of the applicants than\\nthe integrity of the university. Selling seats to the highest bidder is more appropriate for a rock concert\\nor a sporting event than for an educational institution. The just way of allocating access to a good may\\nhave something to do with the nature of that good, with its purpose. The affirmative action debate\\nreflects competing notions of what colleges are for: To what extent should they pursue scholarlyexcellence, to what extent civic goods, and how should these purposes be balanced? Though a college\\neducation also \\nserves the good of preparing students for successful careers, its primary purpose is not\\ncommercial. So selling education as if it were merely a consumer good is a kind of corruption.\\nWhat, then, is the university’s purpose? Harvard is not Wal-Mart—or even Bloomingdales. Its\\npurpose is not to maximize revenue but to serve the common good through teaching and research. It is\\ntrue that teaching and research are expensive, and universities devote much effort to fund-raising. But\\nwhen the goal of money-making predominates to the point of governing admission, the university has\\nstrayed far from the scholarly and civic goods that are its primary reason for being.\\nThe idea that justice in allocating access to a university has something to do with the goods that\\nuniversities properly pursue explains why selling admission is unjust. It also explains why it’s hard to\\nseparate questions of justice and rights from questions of honor and virtue. Universities give honorary\\ndegrees to celebrate those who display the virtues universities exist to promote. But in a way, every\\ndegree a university confers is an honorary degree.\\nTying debates about justice to arguments about honor, virtue, and the meaning of goods may seem a\\nrecipe for hopeless disagreement. People hold different conceptions of honor and virtue. The proper\\nmission of social institutions—whether universities, corporations, the military, the professions, or the\\npolitical community generally—is contested and fraught. So it is tempting to seek a basis for justice and\\nrights that keeps its distance from those controversies.\\nMuch modern political philosophy tries to do just that. As we’ve seen, the philosophies of Kant and\\nRawls are bold attempts to find a basis for justice and rights that is neutral with respect to competing\\nvisions of the good life. It is now time to see if their project succeeds.8. WHO DESERVES WHAT? / ARISTOTLE\\nCallie Smartt\\n was a popular freshman cheerleader at Andrews High School in West Texas. The fact\\nthat she had cerebral palsy and moved about in a wheelchair didn’t dampen the enthusiasm she inspired\\namong the football players and fans by her spirited presence on the sidelines at junior varsity games.\\nBut at the end of the season, Callie was kicked off the squad.\\n1\\nAt the urging of some other cheerleaders and their parents, school officials told Callie that, to make\\nthe squad the next year, she would have to try out like everyone else, in a rigorous gymnastic routine\\ninvolving splits and tumbles. The head cheerleader’s father led the opposition to Callie’s inclusion on the\\ncheerleading team. He claimed he was concerned for her safety. But Callie’s mother suspected the\\nopposition was motivated by resentment of the acclaim Callie received.\\nCallie’s story raises two questions. One is a question of fairness. Should she be required to do\\ngymnastics in order to qualify as a cheerleader, or is this requirement unfair, given her disability? One\\nway of answering this question would be to invoke the principle of nondiscrimination: Provided she can\\nperform well in the role, Callie should not be excluded from cheerleading simply because, through no\\nfault of her own, she lacks the physical ability to perform gymnastic routines.\\nBut the nondiscrimination principle isn’t much help, because it \\nbegs the question at the heart of the\\ncontroversy: What does it mean to perform well in the role of cheerleader? Callie’s opponents claim that\\nto be a good cheerleader you must be able to do tumbles and splits. That, after all, is how cheerleaders\\ntraditionally excite the crowd. Callie’s supporters would say this confuses the purpose of cheerleading\\nwith one way of achieving it. The real point of cheerleading is to inspire school spirit and energize the\\nfans. When Callie roars up and down the sidelines in her wheelchair, waving her pom-poms and flashing\\nher smile, she does well what cheerleaders are supposed to do—fire up the crowd. So in order to\\ndecide what the qualifications should be, we have to decide what’s essential to cheerleading, and\\nwhat’s merely incidental.\\nThe second question raised by Callie’s story is about resentment. What kind of resentment might\\nmotivate the head cheerleader’s father? Why is he bothered by the presence of Callie on the squad? It\\ncan’t be fear that Callie’s inclusion deprives his daughter of a place; she’s already on the team. Nor is it\\nthe simple envy he might feel toward a girl who outshines his daughter at gymnastic routines, which\\nCallie, of course, does not.\\nHere is my hunch: his resentment probably reflects a sense that Callie is being accorded an honor\\nshe doesn’t deserve, in a way that mocks the pride he takes in his daughter’s cheerleading prowess. If\\ngreat cheerleading is something that can be done from a wheelchair, then the honor accorded those\\nwho excel at tumbles and splits is depreciated to some degree.\\nIf Callie should be a cheerleader because she displays, despite her disability, the virtues appropriate\\nto the role, her claim does pose a certain threat to the honor accorded the other cheerleaders. The\\ngymnastic skills they display no longer appear essential to excellence in cheerleading, only one way\\namong others of rousing the crowd. Ungenerous though he was, the father of the head cheerleader\\ncorrectly grasped what was at stake. A social practice once taken as fixed in its purpose and in the\\nhonors it bestowed was now, thanks to Callie, redefined. She had shown that there’s more than one\\nway to be a cheerleader.\\nNotice the connection between the first question, about fairness, and the second, about honor and\\nresentment. In order to determine a fair way to allocate cheerleading positions, we need to determine\\nthe nature and purpose of cheerleading. Otherwise, we have no way of saying what qualities are\\nessential to it. But determining the essence of cheerleading can be controversial, because it embroils us\\nin arguments about what qualities are worthy of honor. What counts as the purpose of cheerleading\\ndepends partly on what virtues you think deserve recognition and reward.\\nAs this episode shows, social practices such as cheerleading have not only an instrumental purpose\\n(cheering on the team) but also an honorific, or exemplary, purpose (celebrating certain excellences and\\nvirtues). In choosing its cheerleaders, the high school not only promotes school spirit but also makes a\\nstatement about the qualities it hopes students will admire and emulate. This explains why the dispute\\nwas so intense. It also explains what is otherwise puzzling—how those already on the team (and theirparents) could feel they had a personal stake in the debate over Callie’s eligibility. These parents\\nwanted cheerleading to honor the traditional cheerleader virtues their daughters possessed.\\nJustice, Telos, and Honor\\nSeen in this way, the dustup over cheerleaders in West Texas is a short course in Aristotle’s theory of\\njustice. Central to Aristotle’s political philosophy are two ideas, both present in the argument over Callie:\\n \\n1. Justice is teleological. Defining rights requires us to figure out the \\ntelos\\n (the purpose, end, or\\nessential nature) of the social practice in question.\\n2. Justice is honorific. To reason about the telos of a practice—or to argue about it—is, at least in\\npart, to reason or argue about what virtues it should honor and reward.\\n \\nThe key to understanding Aristotle’s ethics and politics is to see the force of these two\\nconsiderations, and the relation between them.\\nModern theories of justice try to separate questions of fairness and rights from arguments about\\nhonor, virtue, and moral desert. They seek principles of justice that are neutral among ends, and enable\\npeople to choose and pursue their ends for themselves. Aristotle (384–322 \\nB.C.\\n) does not think justice\\ncan be neutral in this way. He believes that debates about justice are, unavoidably, debates about\\nhonor, virtue, and the nature of the good life.\\nSeeing why Aristotle thinks justice and the good life must be connected will help us see what’s at\\nstake in the effort to separate them.\\nFor Aristotle, justice means giving people what they deserve, giving each person his or her due. But\\nwhat is a person due? What are the relevant grounds of merit or desert? That depends on what’s being\\ndistributed. Justice involves two factors: “things, and the persons to whom things are assigned.” And in\\ngeneral we say that “persons who are equal should have assigned to them equal things.”\\n2\\nBut here there arises a difficult question: Equals in what respect? That depends on what we’re\\ndistributing—and on the virtues relevant to those things.\\nSuppose we’re distributing flutes. Who should get the best ones? Aristotle’s answer: the best flute\\nplayers.\\nJustice discriminates according to merit, according to the relevant excellence. And in the case of flute\\nplaying, the relevant merit is the ability to play well. It would be unjust to discriminate on any other basis,\\nsuch as wealth, or nobility of birth, or physical beauty, or chance (a lottery).\\nBirth and beauty may be greater goods than ability to play the flute, and those who possess\\nthem may, upon balance, surpass the flute-player more in these qualities than he surpasses\\nthem in his flute-playing; but the fact remains that \\nhe\\n is the man who ought to get the better\\nsupply of flutes.\\n3\\nThere is something funny about comparing excellences across vastly disparate dimensions. It may\\nnot even make sense to ask, “Am I more handsome than she is a good lacrosse player?” Or, “Was\\nBabe Ruth a greater baseball player than Shakespeare was a playwright?” Questions such as these\\nmay make sense only as parlor games. Aristotle’s point is that, in distributing flutes, we should not look\\nfor the richest or best-looking or even the best person overall. We should look for the best flute player.\\nThis idea is perfectly familiar. Many orchestras conduct auditions behind a screen, so that the quality\\nof the music can be judged without bias or distraction. Less familiar is Aristotle’s reason. The most\\nobvious reason for giving the best flutes to the best flute players is that doing so will produce the best\\nmusic, making us listeners better off. But this is not Aristotle’s reason. He thinks the best flutes should\\ngo to the best flute players because that’s what flutes are \\nfor\\n—to be played well.\\nThe purpose of flutes is to produce excellent music. Those who can best realize this purpose ought to\\nhave the best ones.\\nNow it’s also true that giving the best instruments to the best musicians will have the welcome effect\\nof producing the best music, which everyone will enjoy—producing the greatest happiness for the\\ngreatest number. But it’s important to see that Aristotle’s reason goes beyond this utilitarianconsideration.\\nHis way of reasoning from the purpose of a good to the proper allocation of the good is an instance of\\nteleological reasoning. (\\nTeleological\\n comes from the Greek word telos, which means purpose, end, or\\ngoal.) Aristotle claims that in order to determine the just distribution of a good, we have to inquire into\\nthe telos, or purpose, of the good being distributed.\\nTeleological Thinking: Tennis Courts and \\nWinnie-the-Pooh\\nTeleological reasoning may seem a strange way to think about justice, but it does have a certain\\nplausibility. Suppose you have to decide how \\nto allocate use of the best tennis courts on a college\\ncampus. You might give priority to those who can pay the most for them, by setting a high fee. Or you\\nmight give priority to campus big shots—the president of the college, say, or the Nobel Prize–winning\\nscientists. But suppose two renowned scientists were playing a rather indifferent tennis game, barely\\ngetting the ball over the net, and the varsity tennis team came along, wanting to use the court. Wouldn’t\\nyou say that the scientists should move to a lesser court so that the varsity players could use the best\\none? And wouldn’t your reason be that excellent tennis players can make the best use of the best\\ncourts, which are wasted on mediocre players?\\nOr suppose a Stradivarius violin is for up sale, and a wealthy collector outbids Itzhak Perlman for it.\\nThe collector wants to display the violin in his living room. Wouldn’t we regard this as something of a\\nloss, perhaps even an injustice—not because we think the auction is unfair, but because the outcome is\\nunfitting? Lying behind this reaction may be the (teleological) thought that a Stradivarius is meant to be\\nplayed, not displayed.\\nIn the ancient world, teleological thinking was more prevalent than it is today. Plato and Aristotle\\nthought that fire rose because it was reaching for the sky, its natural home, and that stones fell because\\nthey were striving to get closer to the earth, where they belonged. Nature was seen as having a\\nmeaningful order. To understand nature, and our place in it, was to grasp its purpose, its essential\\nmeaning.\\nWith the advent of modern science, nature ceased to be seen as a meaningful order. Instead, it came\\nto be understood mechanistically, governed by the laws of physics. To explain natural phenomena in\\nterms of purposes, meanings, and ends was now considered naïve and anthropomorphic. Despite this\\nshift, the temptation to see the world as teleologically ordered, as a purposeful whole, is not wholly\\nabsent. It persists, especially in children, who have to be educated out of seeing the world in this way. I\\nnoticed this when my children were very young, and I read them the book \\nWinnie-the-Pooh\\n, by A. A.\\nMilne. The story \\nevokes a childlike view of nature as enchanted, animated by meaning and purpose.\\nEarly in the book, Winnie-the-Pooh is walking in the forest and comes to a large oak tree. From the\\ntop of the tree, “there came a loud buzzing-noise.”\\nWinnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree, put his head between his paws and began to\\nthink.\\nFirst of all he said to himself: “That buzzing-noise means something. You don’t get a buzzing-\\nnoise like that, just buzzing and buzzing, without its meaning something. If there’s a buzzing-\\nnoise, somebody’s making a buzzing-noise, and the only reason for making a buzzing-noise that\\nI\\n know of is because you’re a bee.”\\nThen he thought another long time, and said: “And the only reason for being a bee that \\nI\\n know\\nof is making honey.”\\nAnd then he got up, and said: “And the only reason for making honey is so as \\nI\\n can eat it.” So\\nhe began to climb the tree.\\n4\\nPooh’s childlike line of thought about the bees is a good example of teleological reasoning. By the\\ntime we are adults, most of us outgrow this way of viewing the natural world, seeing it as charming but\\nquaint. And having rejected teleological thinking in science, we are also inclined to reject it in politics and\\nmorals. But it is not easy to dispense with teleological reasoning in thinking about social institutions and\\npolitical practices. Today, no scientist reads Aristotle’s works on biology or physics and takes them\\nseriously. But students of ethics and politics continue to read and ponder Aristotle’s moral and politicalphilosophy.\\nWhat’s the Telos of a University?\\nThe debate over affirmative action can be recast in terms that echo Aristotle’s account of flutes. We\\nbegin by seeking just criteria of distribution: Who has a right to be admitted? In addressing this question,\\nwe \\nfind ourselves asking (at least implicitly), “What is the purpose, or telos, of a university?”\\nAs is often the case, the telos is not obvious but contestable. Some say universities are for the sake\\nof promoting scholarly excellence, and that academic promise should be the sole criterion of admission.\\nOthers say universities also exist to serve certain civic purposes, and that the ability to become a\\nleader in a diverse society, for example, should be among the criteria of admission. Sorting out the telos\\nof a university seems essential to determining the proper criteria of admission. This brings out the\\nteleological aspect of justice in university admissions.\\nClosely connected to the debate about a university’s purpose is a question about honor: What virtues\\nor excellences do universities properly honor and reward? Those who believe that universities exist to\\ncelebrate and reward scholarly excellence alone are likely to reject affirmative action, whereas those\\nwho believe universities also exist to promote certain civic ideals may well embrace it.\\nThat arguments about universities—and cheerleaders and flutes—naturally proceed in this way bears\\nout Aristotle’s point: Arguments about justice and rights are often arguments about the purpose, or telos,\\nof a social institution, which in turn reflect competing notions of the virtues the institution should honor\\nand reward.\\nWhat can we do if people disagree about the telos, or purpose, of the activity in question? Is it\\npossible to reason about the telos of a social institution, or is the purpose of a university, say, simply\\nwhatever the founding authority or governing board declared it to be?\\nAristotle believes that it is possible to reason about the purpose of social institutions. Their essential\\nnature is not fixed once and for all, but neither is it simply a matter of opinion. (If the purpose of Harvard\\nCollege were simply determined by the intention of its founders, then its primary purpose would still be\\nthe training of Congregationalist ministers.)\\nHow, then, can we reason about the purpose of a social practice in the face of disagreement? And\\nhow do notions of honor and virtue \\ncome into play? Aristotle offers his most sustained answer to these\\nquestions in his discussion of politics.\\nWhat’s the Purpose of Politics?\\nWhen we discuss distributive justice these days, we are concerned mainly with the distribution of\\nincome, wealth, and opportunities. For Aristotle, distributive justice was not mainly about money but\\nabout offices and honors. Who should have the right to rule? How should political authority be\\ndistributed?\\nAt first glance, the answer seems obvious—equally, of course. One person, one vote. Any other way\\nwould be discriminatory. But Aristotle reminds us that all theories of distributive justice discriminate. The\\nquestion is: Which discriminations are just? And the answer depends on the purpose of the activity in\\nquestion.\\nSo, before we can say how political rights and authority should be distributed, we have to inquire into\\nthe purpose, or telos, of politics. We have to ask, “What is political association \\nfor\\n?”\\nThis may seem an unanswerable question. Different political communities care about different things.\\nIt’s one thing to argue about the purpose of a flute, or a university. Notwithstanding the room for\\ndisagreement at the margins, their purposes are more or less circumscribed. The purpose of a flute has\\nsomething to do with making music; the purpose of a university has something to do with education. But\\ncan we really determine the purpose or goal of political activity as such?\\nThese days, we don’t think of politics as such as having some particular, substantive end, but as\\nbeing open to the various ends that citizens may espouse. Isn’t that why we have elections—so that\\npeople can choose, at any given moment, what purposes and ends they want collectively to pursue? To\\nattribute some purpose or end to political community in advance would seem to preempt the right ofcitizens to decide for themselves. It would also risk imposing values not everyone shares. Our\\nreluctance to invest politics with a determinate telos, or \\nend, reflects a concern for individual freedom.\\nWe view politics as a procedure that enables persons to choose their ends for themselves.\\nAristotle doesn’t see it this way. For Aristotle, the purpose of politics is not to set up a framework of\\nrights that is neutral among ends. It is to form good citizens and to cultivate good character.\\n[A]ny polis which is truly so called, and is not merely one in name, must devote itself to the end\\nof encouraging goodness. Otherwise, a political association sinks into a mere alliance . . .\\nOtherwise, too, law becomes a mere covenant . . . “a guarantor of men’s rights against one\\nanother”—instead of being, as it should be, a rule of life such as will make the members of a\\npolis good and just.\\n5\\nAristotle criticizes what he takes to be the two major claimants to political authority—oligarchs and\\ndemocrats. Each has a claim, he says, but only a partial claim. The oligarchs maintain that they, the\\nwealthy, should rule. The democrats maintain that free birth should be the sole criterion of citizenship\\nand political authority. But both groups exaggerate their claims, because both misconstrue the purpose\\nof political community.\\nThe oligarchs are wrong because political community isn’t only about protecting property or promoting\\neconomic prosperity. If it were only about those things, then property owners would deserve the\\ngreatest share of political authority. For their part, the democrats are wrong because political community\\nisn’t only about giving the majority its way. By \\ndemocrats\\n, Aristotle means what we would call\\nmajoritarians. He rejects the notion that the purpose of politics is to satisfy the preferences of the\\nmajority.\\nBoth sides overlook the highest end of political association, which for Aristotle is to cultivate the\\nvirtue of citizens. The end of the state is not “to provide an alliance for mutual defence . . . or to ease\\neconomic exchange and promote economic intercourse.”\\n6\\n For Aristotle, politics is about something\\nhigher. It’s about learning how to live a good life. \\nThe purpose of politics is nothing less than to enable\\npeople to develop their distinctive human capacities and virtues—to deliberate about the common good,\\nto acquire practical judgment, to share in self-government, to care for the fate of the community as a\\nwhole.\\nAristotle acknowledges the usefulness of other, lesser forms of association, such as defense pacts\\nand free trade agreements. But he insists that associations of this kind don’t amount to true political\\ncommunities. Why not? Because their ends are limited. Organizations such as NATO and NAFTA and\\nthe WTO are concerned only with security or economic exchange; they don’t constitute a shared way of\\nlife that shapes the character of the participants. And the same can be said of a city or a state\\nconcerned only with security and trade and that is indifferent to the moral and civic education of its\\nmembers. “If the spirit of their intercourse were still the same after their coming together as it had been\\nwhen they were living apart,” Aristotle writes, their association can’t really be considered a polis, or\\npolitical community.\\n7\\n“A polis is not an association for residence on a common site, or for the sake of preventing mutual\\ninjustice and easing exchange.” While these conditions are necessary to a polis, they are not sufficient.\\n“The end and purpose of a polis is the good life, and the institutions of social life are means to that\\nend.”\\n8\\nIf the political community exists to promote the good life, what are the implications for the distribution\\nof offices and honors? As with flutes, so with politics: Aristotle reasons from the purpose of the good to\\nthe appropriate way of distributing it. “Those who contribute most to an association of this character”\\nare those who excel in civic virtue, those who are best at deliberating about the common good. Those\\nwho are greatest in civic excellence—not the wealthiest, or the most numerous, or the most handsome\\n—are the ones who merit the greatest share of political recognition and influence.\\n9\\nSince the end of politics is the good life, the highest offices and honors should go to people, such as\\nPericles, who are greatest in civic virtue and best at identifying the common good. Property holders\\nshould \\nhave their say. Majoritarian considerations should matter some. But the greatest influence should\\ngo to those with the qualities of character and judgment to decide if and when and how to go to war with\\nSparta.The reason people such as Pericles (and Abraham Lincoln) should hold the highest offices and honors\\nis not simply that they will enact wise policies, making everyone better off. It is also that political\\ncommunity exists, at least in part, to honor and reward civic virtue. According public recognition to those\\nwho display civic excellence serves the educative role of the good city. Here again, we see how the\\nteleological and honorific aspects of justice go together.\\nCan You Be a Good Person If You Don’t Participate in Politics?\\nIf Aristotle is right that the end of politics is the good life, it’s easy to conclude that those who display the\\ngreatest civic virtue merit the highest offices and honors. But is he right that politics is for the sake of\\nthe good life? This is, at best, a controversial claim. These days, we generally view politics as a\\nnecessary evil, not an essential feature of the good life. When we think of politics, we think of\\ncompromise, posturing, special interests, corruption. Even idealistic uses of politics—as an instrument\\nof social justice, as a way to make the world a better place—cast politics as a means to an end, one\\ncalling among others, not as an essential aspect of the human good.\\nWhy, then, does Aristotle think that participating in politics is somehow essential to living a good life?\\nWhy can’t we live perfectly good, virtuous lives without politics?\\nThe answer lies in our nature. Only by living in a polis and participating in politics do we fully realize\\nour nature as human beings. Aristotle sees us as beings “meant for political association, in a higher\\ndegree than bees or other gregarious animals.” The reason he gives is this: Nature makes nothing in\\nvain, and human beings, unlike other animals, are furnished with the faculty of language. Other animals\\ncan make sounds, and sounds can indicate pleasure and pain. But language, \\na distinctly human\\ncapacity, isn’t just for registering pleasure and pain. It’s about declaring what is just and what is unjust,\\nand distinguishing right from wrong. We don’t grasp these things silently, and then put words to them;\\nlanguage is the medium through which we discern and deliberate about the good.\\n10\\nOnly in political association, Aristotle claims, can we exercise our distinctly human capacity for\\nlanguage, for only in a polis do we deliberate with others about justice and injustice and the nature of the\\ngood life. “We thus see that the polis exists by nature and that it is prior to the individual,” he writes in\\nBook I of \\nThe Politics\\n.\\n11\\n By \\nprior\\n, he means prior in function, or purpose, not chronologically prior.\\nIndividuals, families, and clans existed before cities did; but only in the polis are we able to realize our\\nnature. We are not self-sufficient when we are isolated, because we can’t yet develop our capacity for\\nlanguage and moral deliberation.\\nThe man who is isolated—who is unable to share in the benefits of political association, or has\\nno need to share because he is already self-sufficient—is no part of the polis, and must\\ntherefore be either a beast or a god.\\n12\\nSo we only fulfill our nature when we exercise our faculty of language, which requires in turn that we\\ndeliberate with others about right and wrong, good and evil, justice and injustice.\\nBut why, you might wonder, can we exercise this capacity for language and deliberation only in\\npolitics? Why can’t we do it in families, clans, or clubs? To answer this question, we need to consider\\nthe account of virtue and the good life that Aristotle presents in the \\nNicomachean Ethics\\n. Although this\\nwork is primarily about moral philosophy, it shows how acquiring virtue is bound up with being a citizen.\\nThe moral life aims at happiness, but by \\nhappiness\\n Aristotle doesn’t mean what the utilitarians mean\\n—maximizing the balance of pleasure over pain. The virtuous person is someone who takes pleasure\\nand pain \\nin the right things. If someone takes pleasure in watching dog fights, for example, we consider\\nthis a vice to be overcome, not a true source of happiness. Moral excellence does not consist in\\naggregating pleasures and pains but in aligning them, so that we delight in noble things and take pain in\\nbase ones. Happiness is not a state of mind but a way of being, “an activity of the soul in accordance\\nwith virtue.”\\n13\\nBut why is it necessary to live in a polis to live a virtuous life? Why can’t we learn sound moral\\nprinciples at home, or in a philosophy class, or by reading a book about ethics—and then apply them as\\nneeded? Aristotle says we don’t become virtuous that way. “Moral virtue comes about as a result ofhabit.” It’s the kind of thing we learn by doing. “The virtues we get by first exercising them, as also\\nhappens in the case of the arts as well.”\\n14\\nLearning by Doing\\nIn this respect, becoming virtuous is like learning to play the flute. No one learns how to play a musical\\ninstrument by reading a book or listening to a lecture. You have to practice. And it helps to listen to\\naccomplished musicians, and hear how they play. You can’t become a violinist without fiddling. So it is\\nwith moral virtue: “we become just by doing just acts, temperate by doing temperate acts, brave by\\ndoing brave acts.”\\n15\\nIt is similar with other practices and skills, such as cooking. Many cookbooks are published, but no\\none becomes a great chef simply by reading them. You have to do lots of cooking. Joke telling is\\nanother example. You don’t become a comedian by reading joke books and collecting funny stories. Nor\\ncould you simply learn the principles of comedy. You have to practice—the pacing, timing, gestures, and\\ntone—and watch Jack Benny, or Johnny Carson, or Eddie Murphy, or Robin Williams.\\nIf moral virtue is something we learn by doing, we have somehow to develop the right habits in the\\nfirst place. For Aristotle, this is the primary purpose of law—to cultivate the habits that lead to good\\ncharacter.\\n “Legislators make the citizens good by forming habits in them, and this is the wish of every\\nlegislator, and those who do not effect it miss their mark, and it is in this that a good constitution differs\\nfrom a bad one.” Moral education is less about promulgating rules than forming habits and shaping\\ncharacter. “It makes no small difference . . . whether we form habits of one kind or of another from our\\nvery youth; it makes a very great difference, or rather \\nall\\n the difference.”\\n16\\nAristotle’s emphasis on habit does not mean he considers moral virtue a form of rote behavior. Habit\\nis the first step in moral education. But if all goes well, the habit eventually takes, and we come to see\\nthe point of it. The etiquette columnist Judith Martin (aka “Miss Manners”) once bemoaned the lost habit\\nof writing thank-you letters. Nowadays we assume that feelings trump manners, she observed; as long\\nas you feel grateful, you don’t need to bother with such formalities. Miss Manners disagrees: “I think, to\\nthe contrary, that it is safer to hope that practicing proper behavior eventually encourages virtuous\\nfeeling; that if you write enough thank-you letters, you may actually feel a flicker of gratitude.”\\n17\\nThat’s how Aristotle conceives moral virtue. Being steeped in virtuous behavior helps us acquire the\\ndisposition to act virtuously.\\nIt is common to think that acting morally means acting according to a precept or a rule. But Aristotle\\nthinks this misses a distinctive feature of moral virtue. You could be equipped with the right rule and still\\nnot know how or when to apply it. Moral education is about learning to discern the particular features of\\nsituations that call for this rule rather than that one. “Matters concerned with conduct and questions of\\nwhat is good for us have no fixity, any more than matters of health . . . The agents themselves must in\\neach case consider what is appropriate to the occasion, as happens also in the art of medicine or of\\nnavigation.”\\n18\\nThe only general thing that can be said about moral virtue, Aristotle tells us, is that it consists of a\\nmean between extremes. But he readily concedes that this generality doesn’t get us very far, because\\ndiscerning the mean in any given situation is not easy. The challenge is \\nto do the right thing “to the right\\nperson, to the right extent, at the right time, with the right motive, and in the right way.”\\n19\\nThis means that habit, however essential, can’t be the whole of moral virtue. New situations always\\narise, and we need to know which habit is appropriate under the circumstances. Moral virtue therefore\\nrequires judgment, a kind of knowledge Aristotle calls “practical wisdom.” Unlike scientific knowledge,\\nwhich concerns “things that are universal and necessary,”\\n20\\n practical wisdom is about how to act. It\\nmust “recognize the particulars; for it is practical, and practice is concerned with particulars.”\\n21\\n Aristotle\\ndefines practical wisdom as “a reasoned and true state of capacity to act with regard to the human\\ngood.”\\n22\\nPractical wisdom is a moral virtue with political implications. People with practical wisdom can\\ndeliberate well about what is good, not only for themselves but for their fellow citizens, and for humanbeings in general. Deliberation is not philosophizing, because it attends to what is changeable and\\nparticular. It is oriented to action in the here and now. But it is more than calculation. It seeks to identify\\nthe highest human good attainable under the circumstances.\\n23\\nPolitics and the Good Life\\nWe can now see more clearly why, for Aristotle, politics is not one calling among others, but is essential\\nto the good life. First, the laws of the polis inculcate good habits, form good character, and set us on the\\nway to civic virtue. Second, the life of the citizen enables us to exercise capacities for deliberation and\\npractical wisdom that would otherwise lie dormant. This is not the kind of thing we can do at home. We\\ncan sit on the sidelines and wonder what policies we would favor if we had to decide. But this is not the\\nsame as sharing in significant action and bearing responsibility for the fate of the community as a whole.\\nWe become good at deliberating only by entering the arena, weighing the alternatives, arguing our case,\\nruling and being ruled—in short, by being citizens.\\nAristotle’s vision of citizenship is more elevated and strenuous than ours. For him, politics is not\\neconomics by other means. Its purpose is higher than maximizing utility or providing fair rules for the\\npursuit of individual interests. It is, instead, an expression of our nature, an occasion for the unfolding of\\nour human capacities, an essential aspect of the good life.\\nAristotle’s Defense of Slavery\\nNot everyone was included in the citizenship Aristotle celebrated. Women were ineligible, as were\\nslaves. According to Aristotle, their natures did not suit them to be citizens. We now see such exclusion\\nas an obvious injustice. It’s worth recalling that these injustices persisted for more than two thousand\\nyears after Aristotle wrote. Slavery was not abolished in the United States until 1865, and women won\\nthe right to vote only in 1920. Still, the historic persistence of these injustices does not exonerate\\nAristotle for accepting them.\\nIn the case of slavery, Aristotle not only accepted it but offered a philosophical justification. It’s worth\\nexamining his defense of slavery to see what light it sheds on his political theory as a whole. Some see\\nin Aristotle’s argument for slavery a defect in teleological thinking as such; others see it as misguided\\napplication of such thinking, beclouded by the prejudices of his time.\\nI don’t think Aristotle’s defense of slavery reveals a flaw that condemns his political theory as a\\nwhole. But it’s important to see the force of that thoroughgoing claim.\\nFor Aristotle, justice is a matter of fit. To allocate rights is to look for the telos of social institutions,\\nand to fit persons to the roles that suit them, the roles that enable them to realize their nature. Giving\\npersons their due means giving them the offices and honors they deserve and the social roles that\\naccord with their nature.\\nModern political theories are uneasy with the notion of fit. Liberal theories of justice, from Kant to\\nRawls, worry that teleological conceptions \\nare at odds with freedom. For them, justice is not about fit but\\nabout choice. To allocate rights is not to fit people to roles that suit their nature; it is to let people\\nchoose their roles for themselves.\\nFrom this point of view, the notions of telos and fit are suspect, even dangerous. Who is to say what\\nrole is fitting for me, or appropriate to my nature? If I’m not free to choose my social role for myself, I\\nmight well be forced into a role against my will. So the notion of fit can easily slide into slavery, if those\\nin power decide that a certain group is somehow suited for a subordinate role.\\nPrompted by this worry, liberal political theory argues that social roles should be allocated by choice,\\nnot fit. Rather than fit people to roles we think will suit their nature, we should enable people to choose\\ntheir roles for themselves. Slavery is wrong, in this view, because it coerces people into roles they have\\nnot chosen. The solution is to reject an ethic of telos and fit in favor of an ethic of choice and consent.\\nBut this conclusion is too quick. Aristotle’s defense of slavery is no proof against teleological thinking.\\nOn the contrary, Aristotle’s own theory of justice provides ample resources for a critique of his views on\\nslavery. In fact, his notion of justice as fit is more morally demanding, and potentially more critical of\\nexisting allocations of work, than theories based on choice and consent. To see how this is so, let’sexamine Aristotle’s argument.\\nFor slavery to be just, according to Aristotle, two conditions must be met: it must be necessary, and it\\nmust be natural. Slavery is necessary, Aristotle argues, because someone must look after the\\nhousehold chores if citizens are to spend time in the assembly deliberating about the common good. The\\npolis requires a division of labor. Unless we invent machines that could take care of all menial tasks,\\nsome people have to attend to the necessities of life so that others can be free to participate in politics.\\nSo Aristotle concludes that slavery is necessary. But necessity is not enough. For slavery to be just,\\nit must also be the case that certain persons are suited by their nature to perform this role.\\n24\\n So\\nAristotle \\nasks if there are “persons for whom slavery is the better and just condition, or whether the\\nreverse is the case and all slavery is contrary to nature.”\\n25\\n Unless there are such people, the political\\nand economic need for slaves is not enough to justify slavery.\\nAristotle concludes that such people exist. Some people are born to be slaves. They differ from\\nordinary people in the same way that the body differs from the soul. Such people “are by nature slaves,\\nand it is better for them . . . to be ruled by a master.”\\n26\\n“A man is thus by nature a slave if he is capable of becoming (and this is the reason why he also\\nactually becomes) the property of another, and if he participates in reason to the extent of apprehending\\nit in another, though destitute of it himself.\\n27\\n“[J]ust as some are by nature free, so others are by nature slaves, and for these latter the condition\\nof slavery is both beneficial and just.”\\n28\\nAristotle seems to sense something questionable in the claim he is making, because he quickly\\nqualifies it: “But it is easy to see that those who hold an opposite view are also in a way correct.”\\n29\\nLooking at slavery as it existed in the Athens of his day, Aristotle had to admit that the critics had a\\npoint. Many slaves found themselves in that condition for a purely contingent reason: they were formerly\\nfree people who had been captured in war. Their status as slaves had nothing to do with their being fit\\nfor the role. For them, slavery was not natural, but the result of bad luck. By Aristotle’s own standard,\\ntheir slavery is unjust: “Not all those who are actually slaves, or actually freemen, are natural slaves or\\nnatural freemen.”\\n30\\nHow can you tell who is fit to be a slave? Aristotle asks. In principle, you would have to see who, if\\nanyone, flourishes as a slave, and who chafes in the role or tries to flee. The need for force is a good\\nindication that the slave in question is not suited to the role.\\n31\\n For Aristotle, coercion is a sign of\\ninjustice, not because consent legitimates all roles, but because the need for force suggests an\\nunnatural fit. Those who are cast in a role consistent with their nature don’t need to be forced.\\nFor liberal political theory, slavery is unjust because it is coercive. For teleological theories, slavery is\\nunjust because it is at odds with our nature; coercion is a symptom of the injustice, not the source of it.\\nIt is perfectly possible to explain, within the ethic of telos and fit, the injustice of slavery, and Aristotle\\ngoes some way (though not all the way) toward doing so.\\nThe ethic of telos and fit actually sets a more demanding moral standard for justice in the workplace\\nthan does the liberal ethic of choice and consent.\\n32\\n Consider a repetitive, dangerous job, such as\\nworking long hours on an assembly line in a chicken processing plant. Is this form of labor just or unjust?\\nFor the libertarian, the answer would depend on whether the workers had freely exchanged their labor\\nfor a wage: if they did, the work is just. For Rawls, the arrangement would be just only if the free\\nexchange of labor took place against fair background conditions. For Aristotle, even consent against fair\\nbackground conditions is not sufficient; for the work to be just, it has to be suited to the nature of the\\nworkers who perform it. Some jobs fail this test. They are so dangerous, repetitive, and deadening as to\\nbe unfit for human beings. In those cases, justice requires that the work be reorganized to accord with\\nour nature. Otherwise, the job is unjust in the same way that slavery is.\\nCasey Martin’s Golf Cart\\nCasey Martin was a professional golfer with a bad leg. Due to a circulatory disorder, walking the course\\ncaused Martin considerable pain and posed a serious risk of hemorrhaging and fracture. Despite hisdisability, Martin had always excelled at the sport. He played on Stanford’s championship team while in\\ncollege, then turned pro.\\nMartin asked the PGA (Professional Golfers’Association) for permission to use a golf cart during\\ntournaments. The PGA turned him down, citing its rule prohibiting carts in top professional tournaments.\\nMartin took his case to court. He argued that the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990) required\\nreasonable accommodations for people with disabilities, provided the change did not “fundamentally\\nalter the nature” of the activity.\\n33\\nSome of the biggest names in golf testified in the case. Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, and Ken Venturi\\nall defended the ban on carts. They argued that fatigue is an important factor in tournament golf, and that\\nriding rather than walking would give Martin an unfair advantage.\\nThe case went to the United States Supreme Court, where the justices found themselves wrestling\\nwith what seemed to one a silly question, at once beneath their dignity and beyond their expertise: “Is\\nsomeone riding around a golf course from shot to shot \\nreally\\n a golfer?”\\n34\\nIn fact, however, the case raised a question of justice in classic Aristotelian form: In order to decide\\nwhether Martin had a right to a golf cart, the Court had to determine the essential nature of the activity\\nin question. Was walking the course essential to golf, or merely incidental? If, as the PGA claimed,\\nwalking was an essential aspect of the sport, then to let Martin ride in a cart would “fundamentally alter\\nthe nature” of the game. To resolve the question about rights, the court had to determine the telos, or\\nessential nature, of the game.\\nThe Court ruled 7–2 that Martin had a right to use a golf cart. Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for\\nthe majority, analyzed the history of golf and concluded that the use of carts was not inconsistent with\\nthe fundamental character of the game. “From early on, the essence of the game has been shot-making\\n—using clubs to cause a ball to progress from the teeing ground to a hole some distance away with as\\nfew strokes as possible.”\\n35\\n As for the claim that walking tests the physical stamina of golfers, Stevens\\ncited testimony by a physiology professor who calculated that only about five hundred calories were\\nexpended in walking eighteen holes, “nutritionally less than a Big Mac.”\\n36\\n Because golf is “a low\\nintensity activity, fatigue from the game is primarily a psychological phenomenon in which stress and\\nmotivation are the \\nkey ingredients.”\\n37\\n The Court concluded that accommodating Martin’s disability by\\nletting him ride in a cart would not fundamentally alter the game or give him an unfair advantage.\\nJustice Antonin Scalia disagreed. In a spirited dissent, he rejected the notion that the Court could\\ndetermine the essential nature of golf. His point was not simply that judges lack the authority or\\ncompetence to decide the question. He challenged the Aristotelian premise underlying the Court’s\\nopinion—that it is possible to reason about the telos, or essential nature of a game:\\nTo say that something is “essential” is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement\\nof a certain object. But since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except\\namusement (that is what distinguishes games from productive activity), it is quite impossible to\\nsay that any of a game’s arbitrary rules is “essential.”\\n38\\nSince the rules of golf “are (as in all games) entirely arbitrary,” Scalia wrote, there is no basis for\\ncritically assessing the rules laid down by the PGA. If the fans don’t like them, “they can withdraw their\\npatronage.” But no one can say that this or that rule is irrelevant to the skills that golf is meant to test.\\nScalia’s argument is questionable on several grounds. First, it disparages sports. No real fan would\\nspeak of sports that way—as governed by totally arbitrary rules and having no real object or point. If\\npeople really believed that the rules of their favorite sport were arbitrary rather than designed to call\\nforth and celebrate certain skills and talents worth admiring, it would be hard for them to care about the\\noutcome of the game. Sport would fade into spectacle, a source of amusement rather than a subject of\\nappreciation.\\nSecond, it’s perfectly possible to argue the merits of different rules, and to ask whether they improve\\nor corrupt the game. These arguments take place all the time—on radio call-in shows and among those\\nwho govern the game. Consider the debate over the designated-hitter \\nrule in baseball. Some say it\\nimproves the game by enabling the best hitters to bat, sparing weak-hitting pitchers the ordeal. Others\\nsay it damages the game by overemphasizing hitting and removing complex elements of strategy. Each\\nposition rests on a certain conception of what baseball at its best is all about: What skills does it test,what talents and virtues does it celebrate and reward? The debate over the designated-hitter rule is\\nultimately a debate about the telos of baseball—just as the debate over affirmative action is a debate\\nabout the purpose of the university.\\nFinally, Scalia, by denying that golf has a telos, misses altogether the honorific aspect of the dispute.\\nWhat, after all, was the four-year saga over the golf cart really about? On the surface, it was an\\nargument about fairness. The PGA and the golfing greats claimed that allowing Martin to ride would give\\nhim an unfair advantage; Martin replied that, given his disability, the cart would simply level the playing\\nfield.\\nIf fairness were the only thing at stake, however, there is an easy and obvious solution: let all golfers\\nuse carts in the tournaments. If everyone can ride, the fairness objection disappears. But this solution\\nwas anathema to professional golf, even more unthinkable than making an exception for Casey Martin.\\nWhy? Because the dispute was less about fairness than about honor and recognition—specifically the\\ndesire of the PGA and top golfers that their sport be recognized and respected as an athletic event.\\nLet me put the point as delicately as possible: Golfers are somewhat sensitive about the status of\\ntheir game. It involves no running or jumping, and the ball stands still. No one doubts that golf is a\\ndemanding game of skill. But the honor and recognition accorded great golfers depends on their sport\\nbeing seen as a physically demanding athletic competition. If the game at which they excel can be\\nplayed while riding in a cart, their recognition as athletes could be questioned or diminished. This may\\nexplain the vehemence with which some professional golfers opposed Casey Martin’s bid for a cart.\\nHere is Tom Kite, a \\ntwenty-five-year veteran of the PGA Tour, in an op-ed piece in \\nThe New York\\nTimes\\n:\\nIt seems to me that those who support Casey Martin’s right to use a cart are ignoring the fact\\nthat we are talking about a competitive sport. . . . We are talking about an athletic event. And\\nanyone who doesn’t think professional golf is an athletic sport simply hasn’t been there or done\\nthat.\\n39\\nWhoever is right about the essential nature of golf, the federal case over Casey Martin’s cart offers a\\nvivid illustration of Aristotle’s theory of justice. Debates about justice and rights are often, unavoidably,\\ndebates about the purpose of social institutions, the goods they allocate, and the virtues they honor and\\nreward. Despite our best attempts to make law neutral on such questions, it may not be possible to say\\nwhat’s just without arguing about the nature of the good life.9. WHAT DO WE OWE ONE ANOTHER? / DILEMMAS OF LOYALTY\\nIt’s never easy to say,\\n “I’m sorry.” But saying so in public, on behalf of one’s nation, can be especially\\ndifficult. Recent decades have brought a spate of anguished arguments over public apologies for\\nhistoric injustices.\\nApologies and Reparations\\nMuch of the fraught politics of apology involves historic wrongs committed during World War II. Germany\\nhas paid the equivalent of billions of dollars in reparations for the Holocaust, in the form of payments to\\nindividual survivors and to the state of Israel.\\n1\\n Over the years, German political leaders have offered\\nstatements of apology, accepting responsibility for the Nazi past in varying degrees. In a speech to the\\nBundestag in 1951, German chancellor Konrad Adenauer claimed that “the overwhelming majority of the\\nGerman people abominated the crimes committed against the Jews and did not participate in them.” But\\nhe acknowledged that “unspeakable crimes have been committed in the name of the German people,\\ncalling for moral and material indemnity.”\\n2\\n In 2000, German president Johannes Rau apologized for the\\nHolocaust in a speech to the Israeli Knesset, asking “forgiveness for what Germans have done.”\\n3\\nJapan has been more reluctant to apologize for its wartime atrocities. During the 1930s and ’40s, tens\\nof thousands of Korean and other Asian women and girls were forced into brothels and abused as sex\\nslaves by Japanese soldiers.\\n4\\n Since the 1990s, Japan has faced growing international pressure for a\\nformal apology and restitution to the so-called “comfort women.” In the 1990s, a private fund offered\\npayments to the victims, and Japanese leaders made limited apologies.\\n5\\n But as recently as 2007,\\nJapanese prime minister Shinzo Abe insisted that the Japanese military was not responsible for\\ncoercing the women into sexual slavery. The U.S. Congress responded by passing a resolution urging\\nthe Japanese government to formally acknowledge and apologize for its military’s role in enslaving the\\ncomfort women.\\n6\\nOther apology controversies involve historic injustices to indigenous peoples. In Australia, debate has\\nraged in recent years over the government’s obligation to the aboriginal people. From the 1910s to the\\nearly 1970s, aboriginal children of mixed race were forcibly separated from their mothers and placed in\\nwhite foster homes or settlement camps. (In most of these cases, the mothers were aborigines and the\\nfathers white.) The policy sought to assimilate the children to white society and speed the\\ndisappearance of aboriginal culture.\\n7\\n The government-sanctioned kidnappings are portrayed in \\nRabbit-\\nProof Fence\\n (2002), a movie that tells the story of three young girls who, in 1931, escape from a\\nsettlement camp and set out on a 1,200-mile journey to return to their mothers.\\nIn 1997, an Australian human rights commission documented the cruelties inflicted on the “stolen\\ngeneration” of aborigines, and recommended an annual day of national apology.\\n8\\n John Howard, the\\nprime minister at the time, opposed an official apology. The apology question became a contentious\\nissue in Australian politics. In 2008, newly elected prime minister Kevin Rudd issued an official apology\\nto the aboriginal people. Although he did not offer individual compensation, he promised measures to\\novercome the social and economic disadvantages suffered by Australia’s indigenous population.\\n9\\nIn the United States, debates over public apologies and reparations have also gained prominence in\\nrecent decades. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed into law an official apology to Japanese\\nAmericans for their confinement in internment camps on the West Coast during World War II.\\n10\\n In\\naddition to an apology, the legislation provided compensation of $20,000 to each survivor of the camps,\\nand funds to promote Japanese American culture and history. In 1993, Congress apologized for a more\\ndistant historic wrong—the overthrow, a century earlier, of the independent kingdom of Hawaii.\\n11\\nPerhaps the biggest looming apology question in the United States involves the legacy of slavery. The\\nCivil War promise of “forty acres and a mule” for freed slaves never came to be. In the 1990s, themovement for black reparations gained new attention.\\n12\\n Every year since 1989, Congressman John\\nConyers has proposed legislation to create a commission to study reparations for African Americans.\\n13\\nAlthough the reparations idea has won support from many African American organizations and civil rights\\ngroups, it has not caught on with the general public.\\n14\\n Polls show that while a majority of African\\nAmericans favor reparations, only 4 percent of whites do.\\n15\\nAlthough the reparations movement may have stalled, recent years have brought a wave of official\\napologies. In 2007, Virginia, which had been the largest slaveholding state, became the first to\\napologize for slavery.\\n16\\n A number of other states, including Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina, New\\nJersey, and Florida, followed.\\n17\\n And in 2008, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution\\napologizing to African Americans for slavery and for the Jim Crow era of racial segregation that\\nextended into the mid-twentieth century.\\n18\\nShould nations apologize for historic wrongs? To answer this question, we need to think through some\\nhard questions about collective responsibility and the claims of community.\\nThe main justifications for public apologies are to honor the memory of those who have suffered\\ninjustice at the hands (or in the name) of the political community, to recognize the persisting effects of\\ninjustice on \\nvictims and their descendants, and to atone for the wrongs committed by those who inflicted\\nthe injustice or failed to prevent it. As public gestures, official apologies can help bind up the wounds of\\nthe past and provide a basis for moral and political reconciliation. Reparations and other forms of\\nfinancial restitution can be justified on similar grounds, as tangible expressions of apology and\\natonement. They can also help alleviate the effects of the injustice on the victims or their heirs.\\nWhether these considerations are strong enough to justify an apology depends on the circumstances.\\nIn some cases, attempts to bring about public apologies or reparations may do more harm than good—\\nby inflaming old animosities, hardening historic enmities, entrenching a sense of victimhood, or\\ngenerating resentment. Opponents of public apologies often voice worries such as these. Whether, all\\nthings considered, an act of apology or restitution is more likely to heal or damage a political community\\nis a complex matter of political judgment. The answer will vary from case to case.\\nShould We Atone for the Sins of our Predecessors?\\nBut I would like to focus on another argument often raised by opponents of apologies for historic\\ninjustices—a principled argument that does not depend on the contingencies of the situation. This is the\\nargument that people in the present generation should not—in fact, cannot—apologize for wrongs\\ncommitted by previous generations.\\n19\\n To apologize for an injustice is, after all, to take some\\nresponsibility for it. You can’t apologize for something you didn’t do. So, how can you apologize for\\nsomething that was done before you were born?\\nJohn Howard, the Australian prime minister, gave this reason for rejecting an official apology to the\\naborigines: “I do not believe that the current generation of Australians should formally apologize and\\naccept responsibility for the deeds of an earlier generation.”\\n20\\nA similar argument was made in the U.S. debate over reparations for slavery. Henry Hyde, a\\nRepublican congressman, criticized the idea \\nof reparations on these grounds: “I never owned a slave. I\\nnever oppressed anybody. I don’t know that I should have to pay for someone who did [own slaves]\\ngenerations before I was born.”\\n21\\n Walter E. Williams, an African American economist who opposes\\nreparations, voiced a similar view: “If the government got the money from the tooth fairy or Santa Claus,\\nthat’d be great. But the government has to take the money from citizens, and there are no citizens alive\\ntoday who were responsible for slavery.”\\n22\\nTaxing today’s citizens to pay reparations for a past wrong may seem to raise a special problem. But\\nthe same issue arises in debates over apologies that involve no financial compensation.\\nWith apologies, it’s the thought that counts. The thought at stake is the acknowledgment of\\nresponsibility. Anyone can deplore an injustice. But only someone who is somehow implicated in the\\ninjustice can apologize for it. Critics of apologies correctly grasp the moral stakes. And they reject the\\nidea that the current generation can be morally responsible for the sins of their forebears.When the New Jersey state legislature debated the apology question in 2008, a Republican\\nassemblyman asked, “Who living today is guilty of slaveholding and thus capable of apologizing for the\\noffense?” The obvious answer, he thought, was no one: “Today’s residents of New Jersey, even those\\nwho can trace their ancestry back to . . . slaveholders, bear no collective guilt or responsibility for unjust\\nevents in which they personally played no role.”\\n23\\nAs the U.S. House of Representatives prepared to vote an apology for slavery and segregation, a\\nRepublican critic of the measure compared it to apologizing for deeds carried out by your “great-great-\\ngreat-grandfather.”\\n24\\nMoral Individualism\\nThe principled objection to official apologies is not easy to dismiss. It rests on the notion that we are\\nresponsible only for what we ourselves \\ndo, not for the actions of other people, or for events beyond our\\ncontrol. We are not answerable for the sins of our parents or our grandparents or, for that matter, our\\ncompatriots.\\nBut this puts the matter negatively. The principled objection to official apologies carries weight\\nbecause it draws on a powerful and attractive moral idea. We might call it the idea of “moral\\nindividualism.” The doctrine of moral individualism does not assume that people are selfish. It is rather a\\nclaim about what it means to be free. For the moral individualist, to be free is to be subject only to\\nobligations I voluntarily incur; whatever I owe others, I owe by virtue of some act of consent—a choice\\nor a promise or an agreement I have made, be it tacit or explicit.\\nThe notion that my responsibilities are limited to the ones I take upon myself is a liberating one. It\\nassumes that we are, as moral agents, free and independent selves, unbound by prior moral ties,\\ncapable of choosing our ends for ourselves. Not custom or tradition or inherited status, but the free\\nchoice of each individual is the source of the only moral obligations that constrain us.\\nYou can see how this vision of freedom leaves little room for collective responsibility, or for a duty to\\nbear the moral burden of historic injustices perpetrated by our predecessors. If I promised my\\ngrandfather to pay his debts or apologize for his sins, that would be one thing. My duty to carry out the\\nrecompense would be an obligation founded on consent, not an obligation arising from a collective\\nidentity extending across generations. Absent some such promise, the moral individualist can make no\\nsense of a responsibility to atone for the sins of my predecessors. The sins, after all, were theirs, not\\nmine.\\nIf the moral individualist vision of freedom is right, then the critics of official apologies have a point;\\nwe bear no moral burden for the wrongs of our predecessors. But far more than apologies and collective\\nresponsibility are at stake. The individualist view of freedom figures in many of the theories of justice\\nmost familiar in contemporary politics. If that conception of freedom is flawed, as I believe it is, then we\\nneed to rethink some of the fundamental features of our public life.\\nAs we have seen, the notions of consent and free choice loom large, not only in contemporary\\npolitics, but also in modern theories of justice. Let’s look back and see how various notions of choice\\nand consent have come to inform our present-day assumptions.\\nAn early version of the choosing self comes to us from John Locke. He argued that legitimate\\ngovernment must be based on consent. Why? Because we are free and independent beings, not subject\\nto paternal authority or the divine right of kings. Since we are “by nature, all free, equal and independent,\\nno one can be put out of this estate, and subjected to the political power of another, without his own\\nconsent.”\\n25\\nA century later, Immanuel Kant offered a more powerful version of the choosing self. Against the\\nutilitarian and empiricist philosophers, Kant argued that we must think of ourselves as more than a\\nbundle of preferences and desires. To be free is to be autonomous, and to be autonomous is to be\\ngoverned by a law I give myself. Kantian autonomy is more demanding than consent. When I will the\\nmoral law, I don’t simply choose according to my contingent desires or allegiances. Instead, I step back\\nfrom my particular interests and attachments, and will as a participant in pure practical reason.\\nIn the twentieth century, John Rawls adapted Kant’s conception of the autonomous self and drew\\nupon it in his theory of justice. Like Kant, Rawls observed that the choices we make often reflect morallyarbitrary contingencies. Someone’s choice to work in a sweatshop, for example, might reflect dire\\neconomic necessity, not free choice in any meaningful sense. So if we want society to be a voluntary\\narrangement, we can’t base it on actual consent; we should ask instead what principles of justice we\\nwould agree to if we set aside our particular interests and advantages, and chose behind a veil of\\nignorance.\\nKant’s idea of an autonomous will and Rawls’s idea of a hypothetical agreement behind a veil of\\nignorance have this in common: both conceive the moral agent as independent of his or her particular\\naims and attachments. When we will the moral law (Kant) or choose the \\nprinciples of justice (Rawls), we\\ndo so without reference to the roles and identities that situate us in the world and make us the particular\\npeople we are.\\nIf, in thinking about justice, we must abstract from our particular identities, it is hard to make the case\\nthat present-day Germans bear a special responsibility to make recompense for the Holocaust, or that\\nAmericans of this generation have a special responsibility to remedy the injustice of slavery and\\nsegregation. Why? Because once I set aside my identity as a German or an American and conceive\\nmyself as a free and independent self, there is no basis for saying my obligation to remedy these\\nhistoric injustices is greater than anyone else’s.\\nConceiving persons as free and independent selves doesn’t only make a difference for questions of\\ncollective responsibility across generations. It also has a more far-reaching implication: Thinking of the\\nmoral agent in this way carries consequences for the way we think about justice more generally. The\\nnotion that we are freely choosing, independent selves supports the idea that the principles of justice\\nthat define our rights should not rest on any particular moral or religious conception; instead, they should\\ntry to be neutral among competing visions of the good life.\\nShould Government Be Morally Neutral?\\nThe idea that government should try to be neutral on the meaning of the good life represents a departure\\nfrom ancient conceptions of politics. For Aristotle, the purpose of politics is not only to ease economic\\nexchange and provide for the common defense; it is also to cultivate good character and form good\\ncitizens. Arguments about justice are therefore, unavoidably, arguments about the good life. “Before we\\ncan [investigate] the nature of an ideal constitution,” Aristotle wrote, “it is necessary for us first to\\ndetermine the nature of the most desirable way of life. As long as that is obscure, the nature of the ideal\\nconstitution must also remain obscure.”\\n26\\nThese days, the notion that politics is about cultivating virtue strikes many as strange, even\\ndangerous. Who is to say what virtue consists in? And what if people disagree? If the law seeks to\\npromote certain moral and religious ideals, doesn’t this open the way to intolerance and coercion?\\nWhen we think of states that try to promote virtue, we don’t think first of the Athenian polis; we think\\nrather of religious fundamentalism, past and present—stonings for adultery, mandatory burkas, Salem\\nwitch trials, and so on.\\nFor Kant and Rawls, theories of justice that rest on a certain conception of the good life, whether\\nreligious or secular, are at odds with freedom. By imposing on some the values of others, such theories\\nfail to respect persons as free and independent selves, capable of choosing their own purposes and\\nends. So the freely choosing self and the neutral state go hand in hand: It is precisely because we are\\nfree and independent selves that we need a framework of rights that is neutral among ends, that refuses\\nto take sides in moral and religious controversies, that leaves citizens free to choose their values for\\nthemselves.\\nSome might object that no theory of justice and rights can be morally neutral. On one level, this is\\nobviously true. Kant and Rawls are not moral relativists. The idea that persons should be free to choose\\ntheir ends for themselves is itself a powerful moral idea. But it does not tell you how to live your life. It\\nonly requires that, whatever ends you pursue, you do so in a way that respects other people’s rights to\\ndo the same. The appeal of a neutral framework lies precisely in its refusal to affirm a preferred way of\\nlife or conception of the good.\\nKant and Rawls do not deny they are advancing certain moral ideals. Their quarrel is with theories of\\njustice that derive rights from some conception of the good. Utilitarianism is one such theory. It takes\\nthe good to consist in maximizing pleasure or welfare, and asks what system of rights is likely toachieve it. Aristotle offers a very different theory of the good. It is not about maximizing pleasure but\\nabout realizing our nature and developing our distinctly human capacities. Aristotle’s \\nreasoning is\\nteleological in that he reasons from a certain conception of the human good.\\nThis is the mode of reasoning that Kant and Rawls reject. They argue that the right is prior to the\\ngood. The principles that specify our duties and rights should not be based on any particular conception\\nof the good life. Kant writes of “the confusion of the philosophers concerning the supreme principle of\\nmorals.” The ancient philosophers made the mistake of “devoting their ethical investigations entirely to\\nthe definition of the concept of the highest good,” and then trying to make this good “the determining\\nground of the moral law.”\\n27\\n But according to Kant, this has things backward. It is also at odds with\\nfreedom. If we are to think of ourselves as autonomous beings, we must first will the moral law. Only\\nthen, after we’ve arrived at the principle that defines our duties and rights, can we ask what conceptions\\nof the good are compatible with it.\\nRawls makes a similar point with respect to principles of justice: “The liberties of equal citizenship are\\ninsecure when founded upon teleological principles.”\\n28\\n It is easy to see how resting rights on utilitarian\\ncalculations leaves rights vulnerable. If the only reason to respect my right to religious liberty is to\\npromote the general happiness, what happens if someday a large majority despises my religion and\\nwants to ban it?\\nBut utilitarian theories of justice are not the only targets of Rawls and Kant. If the right is prior to the\\ngood, then Aristotle’s way of thinking about justice is also mistaken. For Aristotle, to reason about\\njustice is to reason from the telos, or nature, of the good in question. To think about a just political order,\\nwe have to reason from the nature of the good life. We can’t frame a just constitution until we first figure\\nout the best way to live. Rawls disagrees: “[T]he structure of teleological doctrines is radically\\nmisconceived: from the start they relate the right and the good in the wrong way. We should not attempt\\nto give form to our life by first looking to the good independently defined.”\\n29\\nJustice and Freedom\\nAt stake in this debate is more than the abstract question of how we should reason about justice. The\\ndebate over the priority of the right over the good is ultimately a debate about the meaning of human\\nfreedom. Kant and Rawls reject Aristotle’s teleology because it doesn’t seem to leave us room to\\nchoose our good for ourselves. It is easy to see how Aristotle’s theory gives rise to this worry. He sees\\njustice as a matter of fit between persons and the ends or goods appropriate to their nature. But we are\\ninclined to see justice as a matter of choice, not fit.\\nRawls’s case for the priority of the right over the good reflects the conviction that a “moral person is a\\nsubject with ends he has chosen.”\\n30\\n As moral agents, we are defined not by our ends but by our\\ncapacity for choice. “It is not our aims that primarily reveal our nature” but rather the framework of rights\\nwe would choose if we could abstract from our aims. “For the self is prior to the ends which are affirmed\\nby it; even a dominant end must be chosen from among numerous possibilities . . . We should therefore\\nreverse the relation between the right and the good proposed by teleological doctrines and view the\\nright as prior.”\\n31\\nThe notion that justice should be neutral toward conceptions of the good life reflects a conception of\\npersons as freely choosing selves, unbound by prior moral ties. These ideas, taken together, are\\ncharacteristic of modern liberal political thought. By \\nliberal\\n, I don’t mean the opposite of \\nconservative\\n,\\nas these terms are used in American political debate. In fact, one of the distinctive features of American\\npolitical debate is that the ideals of the neutral state and the freely choosing self can be found across\\nthe political spectrum. Much of the argument over the role of government and markets is a debate about\\nhow best to enable individuals to pursue their ends for themselves.\\nEgalitarian liberals favor civil liberties and basic social and economic rights—rights to health care,\\neducation, employment, income security, and so on. They argue that enabling individuals to pursue their\\nown ends requires that government ensure the material conditions of truly \\nfree choice. Since the time of\\nthe New Deal, proponents of America’s welfare state have argued less in the name of social solidarity\\nand communal obligation than in the name of individual rights and freedom of choice. When Franklin D.\\nRoosevelt launched Social Security in 1935, he did not present it as expressing the mutual obligation ofcitizens to one another. Instead, he designed it to resemble a private insurance scheme, funded by\\npayroll “contributions” rather than general tax revenues.\\n32\\n And when, in 1944, he laid out an agenda for\\nthe American welfare state, he called it an “economic bill of rights.” Rather than offer a communal\\nrationale, FDR argued that such rights were essential to “true individual freedom,” adding, “necessitous\\nmen are not free men.”\\n33\\nFor their part, libertarians (usually called conservatives in contemporary politics, at least on economic\\nissues) also argue for a neutral state that respects individual choice. (Libertarian philosopher Robert\\nNozick writes that government must be “scrupulously . . . neutral between its citizens.”\\n34\\n) But they\\ndisagree with egalitarian liberals about what policies these ideals require. As laissez-faire critics of the\\nwelfare state, libertarians defend free markets and argue that people are entitled to keep the money\\nthey make. “How can a man be truly free,” asked Barry Goldwater, a libertarian conservative and 1964\\nRepublican presidential candidate, “if the fruits of his labor are not his to dispose of, but are treated,\\ninstead, as part of a common pool of public wealth?”\\n35\\n For libertarians, a neutral state requires civil\\nliberties and a strict regime of private property rights. The welfare state, they argue, does not enable\\nindividuals to choose their own ends, but coerces some for the good of others.\\nWhether egalitarian or libertarian, theories of justice that aspire to neutrality have a powerful appeal.\\nThey offer hope that politics and law can avoid becoming entangled in the moral and religious\\ncontroversies that abound in pluralist societies. And they express a heady conception of human freedom\\nthat casts us as the authors of the only moral obligations that constrain us.\\nDespite its appeal, however, this vision of freedom is flawed. So is the aspiration to find principles of\\njustice that are neutral among competing conceptions of the good life.\\n \\nThis is at least the conclusion to which I’m drawn. Having wrestled with the philosophical arguments I’ve\\nlaid before you, and having watched the way these arguments play out in public life, I do not think that\\nfreedom of choice—even freedom of choice under fair conditions—is an adequate basis for a just\\nsociety. What’s more, the attempt to find neutral principles of justice seems to me misguided. It is not\\nalways possible to define our rights and duties without taking up substantive moral questions; and even\\nwhen it’s possible it may not be desirable. I’ll now try to explain why.\\nThe Claims of Community\\nThe weakness of the liberal conception of freedom is bound up with its appeal. If we understand\\nourselves as free and independent selves, unbound by moral ties we haven’t chosen, we can’t make\\nsense of a range of moral and political obligations that we commonly recognize, even prize. These\\ninclude obligations of solidarity and loyalty, historic memory and religious faith—moral claims that arise\\nfrom the communities and traditions that shape our identity. Unless we think of ourselves as\\nencumbered selves, open to moral claims we have not willed, it is difficult to make sense of these\\naspects of our moral and political experience.\\nIn the 1980s, a decade after Rawls’s \\nA Theory of Justice\\n gave American liberalism its fullest\\nphilosophical expression, a number of critics (of which I was one) challenged the ideal of the freely\\nchoosing, unencumbered self along the lines I’ve just suggested. They rejected the claim for the priority\\nof the right over the good, and argued that we can’t reason about justice by abstracting from our aims\\nand attachments. \\nThey became known as the “communitarian” critics of contemporary liberalism.\\nMost of the critics were uneasy with the label, for it seemed to suggest the relativist view that justice\\nis simply whatever a particular community defines it to be. But this worry raises an important point:\\nCommunal encumbrances can be oppressive. Liberal freedom developed as an antidote to political\\ntheories that consigned persons to destinies fixed by caste or class, station or rank, custom, tradition,\\nor inherited status. So how is it possible to acknowledge the moral weight of community while still giving\\nscope to human freedom? If the voluntarist conception of the person is too spare—if all our obligations\\nare not the product of our will—then how can we see ourselves as situated and yet free?Storytelling Beings\\nAlasdair MacIntyre offers a powerful answer to this question. In his book \\nAfter Virtue\\n (1981), he gives\\nan account of the way we, as moral agents, arrive at our purposes and ends. As an alternative to the\\nvoluntarist conception of the person, MacIntyre advances a narrative conception. Human beings are\\nstorytelling beings. We live our lives as narrative quests. “I can only answer the question ‘What am I to\\ndo?’ if I can answer the prior question ‘Of what story or stories do I find myself a part?’”\\n36\\nAll lived narratives, MacIntyre observes, have a certain teleological character. This does not mean\\nthey have a fixed purpose or end laid down by some external authority. Teleology and unpredictability\\ncoexist. “Like characters in a fictional narrative we do not know what will happen next, but none the less\\nour lives have a certain form which projects itself toward our future.”\\n37\\nTo live a life is to enact a narrative quest that aspires to a certain unity or coherence. When\\nconfronted with competing paths, I try to figure out which path will best make sense of my life as a\\nwhole, and of \\nthe things I care about. Moral deliberation is more about interpreting my life story than\\nexerting my will. It involves choice, but the choice issues from the interpretation; it is not a sovereign act\\nof will. At any given moment, others may see more clearly than I do which path, of the ones before me,\\nfits best with the arc of my life; upon reflection, I may say that my friend knows me better than I know\\nmyself. The narrative account of moral agency has the virtue of allowing for this possibility.\\nIt also shows how moral deliberation involves reflection within and about the larger life stories of\\nwhich my life is a part. As MacIntyre writes, “I am never able to seek the good or exercise the virtues\\nonly \\nqua\\n individual.”\\n38\\n I can make sense of the narrative of my life only by coming to terms with the\\nstories in which I find myself. For MacIntyre (as for Aristotle), the narrative, or teleological, aspect of\\nmoral reflection is bound up with membership and belonging.\\nWe all approach our own circumstances as bearers of a particular social identity. I am\\nsomeone’s son or daughter, someone’s cousin or uncle; I am a citizen of this or that city, a\\nmember of this or that guild or profession; I belong to this clan, that tribe, this nation. Hence\\nwhat is good for me has to be the good for one who inhabits these roles. As such, I inherit from\\nthe past of my family, my city, my tribe, my nation, a variety of debts, inheritances, rightful\\nexpectations and obligations. These constitute the given of my life, my moral starting point.\\nThis is in part what gives my own life its moral particularity.\\n39\\nMacIntyre readily concedes that the narrative account is at odds with modern individualism. “From the\\nstandpoint of individualism I am what I myself choose to be.” On the individualist view, moral reflection\\nrequires that I set aside or abstract from my identities and encumbrances: “I cannot be held responsible\\nfor what my country does or has done unless I choose implicitly or explicitly to assume such\\nresponsibility. Such individualism is expressed by those modern Americans \\nwho deny any responsibility\\nfor the effects of slavery upon black Americans, saying, ‘I never owned any slaves.’”\\n40\\n (It should be\\nnoted that MacIntyre wrote these lines almost two decades before Congressman Henry Hyde made\\nexactly this statement in opposing reparations.)\\nMacIntyre offers as a further example “the young German who believes that being born after 1945\\nmeans that what Nazis did to Jews has no moral relevance to his relationship to his Jewish\\ncontemporaries.” MacIntyre sees in this stance a moral shallowness. It wrongly assumes that “the self\\nis detachable from its social and historical roles and statuses.”\\n41\\nThe contrast with the narrative view of the self is clear. For the story of my life is always\\nembedded in the story of those communities from which I derive my identity. I am born with a\\npast; and to try to cut myself off from that past, in the individualist mode, is to deform my\\npresent relationships.\\n42\\nMacIntyre’s narrative conception of the person offers a clear contrast with the voluntarist conception\\nof persons as freely choosing, unencumbered selves. How can we decide between the two? We might\\nask ourselves which better captures the experience of moral deliberation, but that is a hard question to\\nanswer in the abstract. Another way of assessing the two views is to ask which offers a moreconvincing account of moral and political obligation. Are we bound by some moral ties we haven’t\\nchosen and that can’t be traced to a social contract?\\nObligations Beyond Consent\\nRawls’s answer would be no. On the liberal conception, obligations can arise in only two ways—as\\nnatural duties we owe to human beings as such and as voluntary obligations we incur by consent.\\n43\\nNatural duties are universal. We owe them to persons as persons, as rational beings. They include the\\nduty to treat persons with respect, to do justice, to avoid cruelty, and so on. Since they arise from an\\nautonomous \\nwill (Kant) or from a hypothetical social contract (Rawls), they don’t require an act of\\nconsent. No one would say that I have a duty not to kill you only if I promised you I wouldn’t.\\nUnlike natural duties, voluntary obligations are particular, not universal, and arise from consent. If I’ve\\nagreed to paint your house (in exchange for a wage, say, or to repay a favor), I have an obligation to do\\nso. But I don’t have an obligation to paint everyone’s house. On the liberal conception, we must respect\\nthe dignity of all persons, but beyond this, we owe only what we agree to owe. Liberal justice requires\\nthat we respect people’s rights (as defined by the neutral framework), not that we advance their good.\\nWhether we must concern ourselves with the good of other people depends on whether, and with whom,\\nwe have agreed to do so.\\nOne striking implication of this view is that “there is no political obligation, strictly speaking, for\\ncitizens generally.” Although those who run for office voluntarily incur a political obligation (that is, to\\nserve their country if elected), the ordinary citizen does not. As Rawls writes, “it is not clear what is the\\nrequisite binding action or who has performed it.”\\n44\\n So if the liberal account of obligation is right, the\\naverage citizen has no special obligations to his or her fellow citizens, beyond the universal, natural duty\\nnot to commit injustice.\\nFrom the standpoint of the narrative conception of the person, the liberal account of obligation is too\\nthin. It fails to account for the special responsibilities we have to one another as fellow citizens. More\\nthan this, it fails to capture those loyalties and responsibilities whose moral force consists partly in the\\nfact that living by them is inseparable from understanding ourselves as the particular persons we are—\\nas members of this family or nation or people; as bearers of that history; as citizens of this republic. On\\nthe narrative account, these identities are not contingencies we should set aside when deliberating\\nabout morality and justice; they are part of who we are, and so rightly bear on our moral responsibilities.\\nSo one way of deciding between the voluntarist and narrative conceptions of the person is to ask if\\nyou think there is a third category of obligations—call them obligations of solidarity, or membership—\\nthat can’t be explained in contractarian terms. Unlike natural duties, obligations of solidarity are\\nparticular, not universal; they involve moral responsibilities we owe, not to rational beings as such, but\\nto those with whom we share a certain history. But unlike voluntary obligations, they do not depend on\\nan act of consent. Their moral weight derives instead from the situated aspect of moral reflection, from a\\nrecognition that my life story is implicated in the stories of others.\\n \\nTHREE CATEGORIES OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY\\n1. Natural duties: universal; don’t require consent\\n2. Voluntary obligations: particular; require consent\\n3. Obligations of solidarity: particular; don’t require consent\\n \\nSolidarity and Belonging\\nHere are some possible examples of obligations of solidarity or membership. See if you think they carry\\nmoral weight, and if so, whether their moral force can be accounted for in contractarian terms.\\nFamily obligationsThe most elemental example is the special obligation of family members to one another. Suppose two\\nchildren are drowning, and you have time to save only one. One child is your child, and the other is the\\nchild of a stranger. Would it be wrong to rescue your own child? Would it be better to flip a coin? Most\\npeople would say there’s nothing wrong with rescuing your own child, and would find it odd to think that\\nfairness requires flipping a coin. Lying behind this reaction is the thought that parents have special\\nresponsibilities for the welfare of their children. \\nSome argue that this responsibility arises from consent;\\nby choosing to have children, parents voluntarily agree to look after them with special care.\\nTo set aside the matter of consent, consider the responsibility of children to their parents. Suppose\\ntwo aging parents are in need of care; one is my mother, and the other is somebody else’s mother. Most\\npeople would agree that, while it might be admirable if I could care for both, I have a special\\nresponsibility to look after my mother. In this case, it’s not clear that consent can explain why this is so.\\nI didn’t choose my parents; I didn’t even choose to have parents.\\nIt might be argued that the moral responsibility to care for my mother derives from the fact that she\\nlooked after me when I was young. Because she raised me and cared for me, I have an obligation to\\nrepay the benefit. By accepting the benefits she conferred on me, I implicitly consented to pay her back\\nwhen she was in need. Some may find this calculus of consent and reciprocal benefit too cold to\\naccount for familial obligations. But suppose you accept it. What would you say of a person whose\\nparent was neglectful or indifferent? Would you say that the quality of the child-rearing determines the\\ndegree to which the son or daughter is responsible to help the parent in his or her time of need? Insofar\\nas children are obligated to help even bad parents, the moral claim may exceed the liberal ethic of\\nreciprocity and consent.\\nFrench resistance\\nLet’s move from the family to communal obligations. During World War II, members of the French\\nresistance piloted bombing runs over Nazi-occupied France. Although they aimed at factories and other\\nmilitary targets, they were not able to avoid civilian casualties. One day, a bomber pilot receives his\\norders and finds that his target is his home village. (The story may be apocryphal, but it raises an\\nintriguing moral question.) He asks to be excused from the mission. He agrees that bombing this village\\nis as necessary to the goal of liberating France as \\nwas the mission he carried out yesterday, and he\\nknows that if he doesn’t do it, someone else will. But he demurs on the grounds that he can’t be the one\\nto bomb and possibly kill some of his people, his fellow villagers. Even in a just cause, for him to carry\\nout the bombing, he thinks, would be a special moral wrong.\\nWhat do you make of the pilot’s stance? Do you admire it or consider it a form of weakness? Put\\naside the broader question of how many civilian casualties are justified in the cause of liberating\\nFrance. The pilot was not questioning the necessity of the mission or the number of lives that would be\\nlost. His point was that he could not be the one to take these particular lives. Is the pilot’s reluctance\\nmere squeamishness, or does it reflect something of moral importance? If we admire the pilot, it must be\\nbecause we see in his stance a recognition of his encumbered identity as a member of his village, and\\nwe admire the character his reluctance reflects.\\nRescuing Ethiopian Jews\\nIn the early 1980s, a famine in Ethiopia drove some four hundred thousand refugees into neighboring\\nSudan, where they languished in refugee camps. In 1984, the Israeli government undertook a covert\\nairlift called Operation Moses to rescue Ethiopian Jews, known as Falashas, and bring them to Israel.\\n45\\nSome seven thousand Ethiopian Jews were rescued before the plan was halted, after Arab\\ngovernments pressured Sudan not to cooperate with Israel in the evacuation. Shimon Peres, the Israeli\\nprime minister at the time, said, “We shall not rest until all our brothers and sisters from Ethiopia come\\nsafely back home.”\\n46\\n In 1991, when civil war and famine threatened the remaining Ethiopian Jews,\\nIsrael carried out an even bigger airlift, which brought fourteen thousand Falashas to Israel.\\n47\\nDid Israel do the right thing to rescue the Ethiopian Jews? It is hard to see the airlift as other than\\nheroic. The Falashas were in desperate circumstances, and they wanted to come to Israel. And Israel,as a Jewish \\nstate founded in the wake of the Holocaust, was created to provide a homeland for Jews.\\nBut suppose someone posed the following challenge: Hundreds of thousands of Ethiopian refugees\\nwere suffering from famine. If, given its limited resources, Israel was able to rescue only a small portion\\nof them, why shouldn’t it have conducted a lottery to determine which seven thousand Ethiopians to\\nsave? Why wasn’t the airlift of Ethiopian Jews, rather than Ethiopians generally, an act of unfair\\ndiscrimination?\\nIf you accept obligations of solidarity and belonging, the answer is obvious: Israel has a special\\nresponsibility to rescue Ethiopian Jews that goes beyond its duty (and that of all nations) to help\\nrefugees generally. Every nation has a duty to respect human rights, which requires that it provide help,\\naccording to its ability, to human beings anywhere who are suffering from famine, persecution, or\\ndisplacement from their homes. This is a universal duty that can be justified on Kantian grounds, as a\\nduty we owe persons as persons, as fellow human beings (category 1). The question we are trying to\\ndecide is whether nations have further, special responsibilities to care for their people. By referring to\\nthe Ethiopian Jews as “our brothers and sisters,” the Israeli prime minister invoked a familiar metaphor\\nof solidarity. Unless you accept some such notion, you would be hard pressed to explain why Israel\\nshould not have conducted its airlift by lottery. You would also have a hard time defending patriotism.\\nIs Patriotism a Virtue?\\nPatriotism is a much contested moral sentiment. Some view love of country as an unassailable virtue,\\nwhile others see it as a source of mindless obedience, chauvinism, and war. Our question is more\\nparticular: Do citizens have obligations to one another that go beyond the duties they have to other\\npeople in the world? And if they do, can these obligations be accounted for on the basis of consent\\nalone?\\nJean-Jacques Rousseau, an ardent defender of patriotism, argues that \\ncommunal attachments and\\nidentities are necessary supplements to our universal humanity. “It seems that the sentiment of\\nhumanity evaporates and weakens in being extended over the entire world, and that we cannot be\\naffected by the calamities in Tartary or Japan the way we are by those of a European people. Interest\\nand commiseration must somehow be limited and restrained to be active.” Patriotism, he suggests, is a\\nlimiting principle that intensifies fellow feeling. “It is a good thing that the humanity concentrated among\\nfellow citizens takes on new force through the habit of seeing each other and through the common\\ninterest that unites them.”\\n48\\n But if fellow citizens are bound by ties of loyalty and commonality, this\\nmeans they owe more to one another than to outsiders.\\nDo we want people to be virtuous? Let us begin then by making them love their country. But\\nhow can they love it, if their country means nothing more to them than it does to foreigners,\\nallotting to them only what it cannot refuse to anyone?\\n49\\nCountries do provide more to their own people than they do to foreigners. U.S. citizens, for example,\\nare eligible for many forms of public provision—public education, unemployment compensation, job\\ntraining, Social Security, Medicare, welfare, food stamps, and so on—that foreigners are not. In fact,\\nthose who oppose a more generous immigration policy worry that the new entrants will take advantage\\nof social programs American taxpayers have paid for. But this raises the question of why American\\ntaxpayers are more responsible for their own needy citizens than for those who live elsewhere.\\nSome people dislike all forms of public assistance, and would like to scale back the welfare state.\\nOthers believe we should be more generous than we are in providing foreign aid to assist people in\\ndeveloping countries. But almost everyone recognizes a distinction between welfare and foreign aid.\\nAnd most agree that we have a special responsibility to meet the needs of our own citizens that does\\nnot extend to everyone in the world. Is this distinction morally defensible, or is it \\nmere favoritism, a\\nprejudice for our own kind? What, really, is the moral significance of national boundaries? In terms of\\nsheer need, the billion people around the world who live on less than a dollar a day are worse off than\\nour poor.\\nLaredo, Texas, and Juarez, Mexico, are two adjacent towns separated by the Rio Grande. A child\\nborn in Laredo is eligible for all of the social and economic benefits of the American welfare state, andhas the right to seek employment anywhere in the United States when she comes of age. A child born\\non the other side of the river is entitled to none of these things. Nor does she have the right to cross the\\nriver. Through no doing of their own, the two children will have very different life prospects, simply by\\nvirtue of their place of birth.\\nThe inequality of nations complicates the case for national community. If all countries had comparable\\nwealth, and if every person were a citizen of some country or other, the obligation to take special care\\nof one’s own people would not pose a problem—at least not from the standpoint of justice. But in a world\\nwith vast disparities between rich and poor countries, the claims of community can be in tension with the\\nclaims of equality. The volatile issue of immigration reflects this tension.\\nBorder patrols\\nImmigration reform is a political minefield. About the only aspect of immigration policy that commands\\nbroad political support is the resolve to secure the U.S. border with Mexico to limit the flow of illegal\\nimmigrants. Texas sheriffs recently developed a novel use of the Internet to help them keep watch on\\nthe border. They installed video cameras at places known for illegal crossings, and put live video feeds\\nfrom the cameras on a Web site. Citizens who want to help monitor the border can go online and serve\\nas “virtual Texas deputies.” If they see anyone trying to cross the border, they send a report to the\\nsheriff’s office, which follows up, sometimes with the help of the U.S. Border Patrol.\\nWhen I heard about this Web site on National Public Radio, I wondered what motivates the people\\nwho sit at their computer screens and watch. It must be rather tedious work, with long stretches of in\\nactivity and no remuneration. The reporter interviewed a South Texas truck driver who is among the\\ntens of thousands who’ve logged on. After a long day of work, the trucker “comes home, sets his six-\\nfoot, six-inch, 250-pound frame in front of his computer, pops a Red Bull . . . and starts protecting his\\ncountry.” Why does he do it, the reporter asked? “This gives me a little edge feeling,” the trucker replied,\\n“like I’m doing something for law enforcement as well as for our own country.”\\n50\\nIt’s an odd expression of patriotism, perhaps, but it raises a question at the heart of the immigration\\ndebate: On what grounds are nations justified in preventing outsiders from joining their ranks?\\nThe best argument for limiting immigration is a communal one. As Michael Walzer writes, the ability to\\nregulate the conditions of membership, to set the terms of admission and exclusion, is “at the core of\\ncommunal independence.” Otherwise, “there could not be \\ncommunities of character\\n, historically stable,\\nongoing associations of men and women with some special commitment to one another and some\\nspecial sense of their common life.”\\n51\\nFor affluent nations, however, restrictive immigration policies also serve to protect privilege. Many\\nAmericans fear that allowing large numbers of Mexicans to immigrate to the United States would impose\\na significant burden on social services and reduce the economic well-being of existing citizens. It’s not\\nclear whether this fear is justified. But suppose, for the sake of argument, that open immigration would\\nreduce the American standard of living. Would that be sufficient grounds for restricting it? Only if you\\nbelieve that those born on the affluent side of the Rio Grande are entitled to their good fortune. Since\\nthe accident of birth is no basis for entitlement, however, it is hard to see how restrictions on\\nimmigration can be justified in the name of preserving affluence.\\nA stronger argument for limiting immigration is to protect the jobs \\nand wage levels of low-skilled\\nAmerican workers, those most vulnerable to displacement by an influx of immigrants willing to work for\\nless. But this argument takes us back to the question we are trying to resolve: Why should we protect\\nour own most vulnerable workers if it means denying job opportunities to people from Mexico who are\\neven less well-off?\\nFrom the standpoint of helping the least advantaged, a case could be made for open immigration. And\\nyet, even people with egalitarian sympathies hesitate to endorse it.\\n52\\n Is there a moral basis for this\\nreluctance? Yes, but only if you accept that we have a special obligation for the welfare of our fellow\\ncitizens by virtue of the common life and history we share. And this depends on accepting the narrative\\nconception of personhood, according to which our identity as moral agents is bound up with the\\ncommunities we inhabit. As Walzer writes, “It is only if patriotic sentiment has some moral basis, only if\\ncommunal cohesion makes for obligations and shared meanings, only if there are members as well asstrangers, that state officials would have any reason to worry especially about the welfare of their own\\npeople . . . and the success of their own culture and politics.”\\n53\\nIs it unfair to “Buy American”?\\nImmigration is not the only way that American jobs can be lost to outsiders. These days, capital and\\ngoods cross national boundaries more easily than people do. This, too, raises questions about the\\nmoral status of patriotism. Consider the familiar slogan “Buy American.” Is it patriotic to buy a Ford\\nrather than a Toyota? As cars and other manufactured goods are increasingly produced through global\\nsupply chains, it becomes harder to know exactly what counts as an American-made car. But let’s\\nassume we can identify goods that create jobs for Americans. Is that a good reason to buy them? Why\\nshould we be more interested in creating jobs for American workers than for workers in Japan or India or\\nChina?\\nIn early 2009, the U.S. Congress passed and President Obama signed an economic stimulus package\\nof $787 billion. The law contained a requirement that public works funded by the bill—roads, bridges,\\nschools, and public buildings—use American-made steel and iron. “It just makes sense that, where\\npossible, we try to stimulate our own economy, rather than the economy of other countries,” explained\\nSenator Byron Dorgan, (D-N.D.), a defender of the “Buy American” provision.\\n54\\n Opponents of the\\nprovision feared it would prompt retaliation against American goods by other countries, worsen the\\neconomic downturn, and wind up costing American jobs.\\n55\\n But no one questioned the assumption that\\nthe purpose of the stimulus package should be to create jobs in the United States rather than overseas.\\nThis assumption was made vivid in a term economists began using to describe the risk that U.S. federal\\nspending would fund jobs abroad: \\nleakage\\n. A cover story in \\nBusinessWeek\\n focused on the leakage\\nquestion: “How much of Obama’s mammoth fiscal stimulus will ‘leak’ abroad, creating jobs in China,\\nGermany, or Mexico rather than the U.S.?”\\n56\\nAt a time when workers every where are facing job losses, it is understandable that American policy-\\nmakers take as their first priority the protection of American jobs. But the language of leakage brings us\\nback to the moral status of patriotism. From the standpoint of need alone, it is hard to argue for helping\\nunemployed U.S. workers over unemployed workers in China. And yet few would quarrel with the notion\\nthat Americans have a special obligation to help their fellow citizens contend with hard times.\\nIt is difficult to account for this obligation in terms of consent. I never agreed to help steelworkers in\\nIndiana or farm workers in California. Some would argue that I’ve implicitly agreed; because I benefit\\nfrom the complex scheme of interdependence represented by a national economy, I owe an obligation of\\nreciprocity to the other participants in this economy—even though I’ve never met them, and even though\\nI’ve never actually exchanged any goods or services with most of them. But this is a stretch. If we tried\\nto trace the far-flung skein of \\neconomic exchange in the contemporary world, we would probably find that\\nwe rely as much on people who live half a world away as we do on people in Indiana.\\nSo, if you believe that patriotism has a moral basis, if you believe that we have special\\nresponsibilities for the welfare of our fellow citizens, then you must accept the third category of\\nobligation—obligations of solidarity or membership that can’t be reduced to an act of consent.\\nIs Solidarity a Prejudice for Our Own Kind?\\nOf course, not everyone agrees that we have special obligations to our family, comrades, or fellow\\ncitizens. Some argue that so-called obligations of solidarity are actually just instances of collective\\nselfishness, a prejudice for our own kind. These critics concede that we typically care more for our\\nfamily, friends, and comrades than we do for other people. But, they ask, isn’t this heightened concern\\nfor one’s own people a parochial, inward-looking tendency that we should overcome rather than valorize\\nin the name of patriotism or fraternity?\\nNo, not necessarily. Obligations of solidarity and membership point outward as well as inward. Some\\nof the special responsibilities that flow from the particular communities I inhabit I may owe to fellow\\nmembers. But others I may owe to those with whom my community has a morally burdened history, as inthe relation of Germans to Jews, or of American whites to African Americans. Collective apologies and\\nreparations for historic injustices are good examples of the way solidarity can create moral\\nresponsibilities for communities other than my own. Making amends for my country’s past wrongs is one\\nway of affirming my allegiance to it.\\nSometimes solidarity can give us special reason to criticize our own people or the actions of our\\ngovernment. Patriotism can compel dissent. Take for example two different grounds that led people to\\noppose the Vietnam War and protest against it. One was the belief that the war \\nwas unjust; the other\\nwas the belief that the war was unworthy of us and at odds with who we are as a people. The first\\nreason can be taken up by opponents of the war whoever they are or wherever they live. But the\\nsecond reason can be felt and voiced only by citizens of the country responsible for the war. A Swede\\ncould oppose the Vietnam War and consider it unjust, but only an American could feel ashamed of it.\\nPride and shame are moral sentiments that presuppose a shared identity. Americans traveling abroad\\ncan be embarrassed when they encounter boorish behavior by American tourists, even though they\\ndon’t know them personally. Non-Americans might find the same behavior disreputable but could not be\\nembarrassed by it.\\nThe capacity for pride and shame in the actions of family members and fellow citizens is related to the\\ncapacity for collective responsibility. Both require seeing ourselves as situated selves—claimed by\\nmoral ties we have not chosen and implicated in the narratives that shape our identity as moral agents.\\nGiven the close connection between an ethic of pride and shame and an ethic of collective\\nresponsibility, it is puzzling to find political conservatives rejecting collective apologies on individualist\\ngrounds (as did Henry Hyde, John Howard, and others mentioned earlier). To insist that we are, as\\nindividuals, responsible only for the choices we make and the acts we perform makes it difficult to take\\npride in the history and traditions of one’s country. Anyone anywhere can admire the Declaration of\\nIndependence, the Constitution, Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, the fallen heroes honored in Arlington\\nNational Cemetery, and so on. But patriotic pride requires a sense of belonging to a community\\nextended across time.\\nWith belonging comes responsibility. You can’t really take pride in your country and its past if you’re\\nunwilling to acknowledge any responsibility for carrying its story into the present, and discharging the\\nmoral burdens that may come with it.\\nCan Loyalty Override Universal Moral Principles?\\nIn most of the cases we’ve considered, the demands of solidarity seem to supplement rather than\\ncompete with natural duties or human rights. So it might be argued that these cases highlight a point that\\nliberal philosophers are happy to concede: As long as we don’t violate anyone’s rights, we can fulfill the\\ngeneral duty to help others by helping those who are close at hand—such as family members or fellow\\ncitizens. There’s nothing wrong with a parent rescuing his own child rather than another, provided he\\ndoesn’t run over a stranger’s child on the way to the rescue. Similarly, there’s nothing wrong with a rich\\ncountry setting up a generous welfare state for its own citizens, provided it respects the human rights of\\npersons everywhere. Obligations of solidarity are objectionable only if they lead us to violate a natural\\nduty.\\nIf the narrative conception of the person is right, however, obligations of solidarity can be more\\ndemanding than the liberal account suggests—even to the point of competing with natural duties.\\nRobert E. Lee\\nConsider the case of Robert E. Lee, the commanding general of the Confederate army. Before the Civil\\nWar, Lee was an officer in the Union army. He opposed secession—in fact, he regarded it as treason.\\nWhen war loomed, President Lincoln asked Lee to lead the Union forces. Lee refused. He concluded\\nthat his obligation to Virginia outweighed his obligation to the Union, and also his reported opposition to\\nslavery. He explained his decision in a letter to his sons:\\nWith all my devotion to the Union, I have not been able to make up my mind to raise my handagainst my relatives, my children, my home . . . If the Union is dissolved, and the Government\\ndisrupted, I shall return to my native State and share the miseries of my people. Save in her\\ndefense, I will draw my sword no more.\\n57\\nLike the French resistance pilot, Lee could not countenance a role that would require him to inflict\\nharm on his relatives, his children, his home. But his loyalty went further, even to the point of leading his\\npeople in a cause he opposed.\\nSince the cause of the Confederacy included not only secession but slavery, it is hard to defend\\nLee’s choice. Still, it is hard not to admire the loyalty that gave rise to his dilemma. But why should we\\nadmire loyalty to an unjust cause? You might well wonder whether loyalty, under these circumstances,\\nshould carry any moral weight at all. Why, you might ask, is loyalty a virtue rather than just a sentiment,\\na feeling, an emotional tug that beclouds our moral judgment and makes it hard to do the right thing?\\nHere’s why: Unless we take loyalty seriously, as a claim with moral import, we can’t make sense of\\nLee’s dilemma as a moral dilemma at all. If loyalty is a sentiment with no genuine moral weight, then\\nLee’s predicament is simply a conflict between morality on the one hand and mere feeling or prejudice\\non the other. But by conceiving it that way, we misunderstand the moral stakes.\\n58\\nThe merely psychological reading of Lee’s predicament misses the fact that we not only sympathize\\nwith people like him but also admire them, not necessarily for the choices they make, but for the quality\\nof character their deliberation reflects. What we admire is the disposition to see and bear one’s life\\ncircumstance as a reflectively situated being—claimed by the history that implicates me in a particular\\nlife, but self-conscious of its particularity, and so alive to competing claims and wider horizons. To have\\ncharacter is to live in recognition of one’s (sometime conflicting) encumbrances.\\nBrothers’ keepers I: The Bulger brothers\\nA more recent test of loyalty’s moral weight involves two brotherly tales: The first is the story of William\\nand James (“Whitey”) Bulger. Bill and Whitey grew up together in a family of nine children in a \\nSouth\\nBoston housing project. Bill was a conscientious student who studied the classics and got a law degree\\nat Boston College. His older brother, Whitey, was a high-school dropout who spent his time on the\\nstreets committing larceny and other crimes.\\nEach rose to power in his respective world. William Bulger entered politics, became president of the\\nMassachusetts State Senate (1978–1996), then served for seven years as president of the University\\nof Massachusetts. Whitey served time in federal prison for bank robbery, then rose to become the\\nleader of the ruthless Winter Hill Gang, an organized crime group that controlled extortion, drug deals,\\nand other illegal activities in Boston. Charged with nineteen murders, Whitey fled to avoid arrest in\\n1995. He is still at large, and occupies a place on the FBI’s “Ten Most Wanted” list.\\n59\\nAlthough William Bulger spoke with his fugitive brother by phone, he claimed not to know his\\nwhereabouts, and refused to assist authorities in finding him. When William testified before a grand jury\\nin 2001, a federal prosecutor pressed him without success for information on his brother: “So just to be\\nclear, you felt more loyalty to your brother than you did to the people of the Commonwealth of\\nMassachusetts?”\\n“I never thought about it that way,” Bulger replied. “But I do have an honest loyalty to my brother, and I\\ncare about him . . . It’s my hope that I’m never helpful to anyone against him . . . I don’t have an\\nobligation to help everyone catch him.”\\n60\\nIn the taverns of South Boston, patrons expressed admiration for Bulger’s loyalty. “I don’t blame him\\nfor not telling on his brother,” one resident told \\nThe Boston Globe\\n. “Brothers are brothers. Are you going\\nto squeal on your family?”\\n61\\n Editorial boards and newspaper reporters were more critical. “Instead of\\ntaking the righteous road,” one columnist wrote, “he chose the code of the street.”\\n62\\n Under public\\npressure for his refusal to assist in the search for his brother, Bulger resigned as president of the\\nUniversity of Massachusetts in 2003, though he was not charged with obstructing the investigation.\\n63\\nUnder most circumstances, the right thing to do is to help bring a murder suspect to justice. Can family\\nloyalty override this duty? William Bulger apparently thought so. But a few years earlier, another figurewith a wayward brother made a different call.\\nBrothers’ keepers II: The Unabomber\\nFor more than seventeen years, authorities had tried to find the domestic terrorist responsible for a\\nseries of package bombs that killed three people and injured twenty-three others. Because his targets\\nincluded scientists and other academics, the elusive bomb maker was known as the Unabomber. To\\nexplain the cause behind his deeds, the Unabomber posted a thirty-five-thousand-word anti-technology\\nmanifesto on the Internet, and promised to stop bombing if \\nThe New York Times\\n and \\nThe Washington\\nPost\\n both printed the manifesto, which they did.\\n64\\nWhen David Kaczynski, a forty-six-year-old social worker in Schenectady, New York, read the\\nmanifesto, he found it eerily familiar. It contained phrases and opinions that sounded like those of his\\nolder brother, Ted, age fifty-four, a Harvard-trained mathematician turned recluse. Ted despised modern\\nindustrial society and was living in a mountain cabin in Montana. David had not seen him for a\\ndecade.\\n65\\nAfter much anguish, in 1996 David informed the FBI of his suspicion that the Unabomber was his\\nbrother. Federal agents staked out Ted Kaczynski’s cabin and arrested him. Although David had been\\ngiven to understand that prosecutors would not seek the death penalty, they did. The prospect of\\nbringing about the death of his brother was an agonizing thought. In the end, prosecutors allowed Ted\\nKaczynski to plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of life in prison without parole.\\n66\\nTed Kaczynski refused to acknowledge his brother in court and, in a book manuscript he wrote in\\nprison, called him “another Judas Iscariot.”\\n67\\n David Kaczynski tried to rebuild his life, which was\\nindelibly \\nmarked by the episode. After working to spare his brother the death penalty, he became a\\nspokesman for an anti–capital punishment group. “Brothers are supposed to protect each other,” he told\\none audience, describing his dilemma, “and here, perhaps, I was sending my brother to his death.”\\n68\\n He\\naccepted the $1 million reward offered by the Justice Department for helping apprehend the Unabomber,\\nbut gave most of it to the families of those killed and injured by his brother. And he apologized, on behalf\\nof his family, for his brother’s crimes.\\n69\\nWhat do you make of the way William Bulger and David Kaczynski contended with their brothers? For\\nBulger, family loyalty outweighed the duty to bring a criminal to justice; for Kaczynski, the reverse.\\nPerhaps it makes a moral difference whether the brother at large poses a continuing threat. This\\nseemed to weigh heavily for David Kaczynski: “I guess it’s fair to say I felt compelled. The thought that\\nanother person would die and I was in the position to stop that—I couldn’t live with that.”\\n70\\nHowever you judge the choices they made, it is hard to read their stories without coming to this\\nconclusion: the dilemmas they faced make sense as moral dilemmas only if you acknowledge that the\\nclaims of loyalty and solidarity can weigh in the balance against other moral claims, including the duty to\\nbring criminals to justice. If all our obligations are founded on consent, or on universal duties we owe\\npersons as persons, it’s hard to account for these fraternal predicaments.\\nJustice and the Good Life\\nWe’ve now considered a range of examples meant to challenge the contractarian idea that we are the\\nauthors of the only moral obligations that constrain us: public apologies and reparations; collective\\nresponsibility for historic injustice; the special responsibilities of family members, and of fellow citizens,\\nfor one another; solidarity with comrades; allegiance to one’s village, community, or country; patriotism;\\npride and shame in one’s nation or people; fraternal and filial loyalties. The \\nclaims of solidarity seen in\\nthese examples are familiar features of our moral and political experience. It would be difficult to live, or\\nto make sense of our lives, without them. But it is equally difficult to account for them in the language of\\nmoral individualism. They can’t be captured by an ethic of consent. That is, in part, what gives these\\nclaims their moral force. They draw on our encumbrances. They reflect our nature as storytelling beings,\\nas situated selves.\\nWhat, you may be wondering, does all this have to do with justice? To answer this question, let’sWhat, you may be wondering, does all this have to do with justice? To answer this question, let’s\\nrecall the questions that led us down this path. We’ve been trying to figure out whether all our duties and\\nobligations can be traced to an act of will or choice. I’ve argued that they cannot; obligations of\\nsolidarity or membership may claim us for reasons unrelated to a choice—reasons bound up with the\\nnarratives by which we interpret our lives and the communities we inhabit.\\nWhat exactly is at stake in this debate between the narrative account of moral agency and the one\\nthat emphasizes will and consent? One issue at stake is how you conceive human freedom. As you\\nponder the examples that purport to illustrate obligations of solidarity and membership, you might find\\nyourself resisting them. If you are like many of my students, you might dislike or mistrust the idea that\\nwe’re bound by moral ties we haven’t chosen. This dislike might lead you to reject the claims of\\npatriotism, solidarity, collective responsibility, and so on; or to recast these claims as arising from some\\nform of consent. It’s tempting to reject or to recast these claims because doing so renders them\\nconsistent with a familiar idea of freedom. This is the idea that says we are unbound by any moral ties\\nwe haven’t chosen; to be free is to be the author of the only obligations that constrain us.\\nI am trying to suggest, through these and other examples we consider throughout this book, that this\\nconception of freedom is flawed. But freedom is not the only issue at stake here. Also at stake is how to\\nthink about justice.\\nRecall the two ways of thinking about justice we’ve considered. For Kant and Rawls, the right is prior\\nto the good. The principles of justice \\nthat define our duties and rights should be neutral with respect to\\ncompeting conceptions of the good life. To arrive at the moral law, Kant argues, we must abstract from\\nour contingent interests and ends. To deliberate about justice, Rawls maintains, we should set aside our\\nparticular aims, attachments, and conceptions of the good. That’s the point of thinking about justice\\nbehind a veil of ignorance.\\nThis way of thinking about justice is at odds with Aristotle’s way. He doesn’t believe that principles of\\njustice can or should be neutral with respect to the good life. To the contrary, he maintains that one of\\nthe purposes of a just constitution is to form good citizens and to cultivate good character. He doesn’t\\nthink it’s possible to deliberate about justice without deliberating about the meaning of the goods—the\\noffices, honors, rights, and opportunities—that societies allocate.\\nOne of the reasons Kant and Rawls reject Aristotle’s way of thinking about justice is that they don’t\\nthink it leaves room for freedom. A constitution that tries to cultivate good character or to affirm a\\nparticular conception of the good life risks imposing on some the values of others. It fails to respect\\npersons as free and independent selves, capable of choosing their ends for themselves.\\nIf Kant and Rawls are right to conceive freedom in this way, then they are right about justice as well.\\nIf we are freely choosing, independent selves, unbound by moral ties antecedent to choice, then we\\nneed a framework of rights that is neutral among ends. If the self is prior to its ends, then the right must\\nbe prior to the good.\\nIf, however, the narrative conception of moral agency is more persuasive, then it may be worth\\nreconsidering Aristotle’s way of thinking about justice. If deliberating about my good involves reflecting\\non the good of those communities with which my identity is bound, then the aspiration to neutrality may\\nbe mistaken. It may not be possible, or even desirable, to deliberate about justice without deliberating\\nabout the good life.\\nThe prospect of bringing conceptions of the good life into public discourse about justice and rights\\nmay strike you as less than appealing—even \\nfrightening. After all, people in pluralist societies such as\\nours disagree about the best way to live. Liberal political theory was born as an attempt to spare politics\\nand law from becoming embroiled in moral and religious controversies. The philosophies of Kant and\\nRawls represent the fullest and clearest expression of that ambition.\\nBut this ambition cannot succeed. Many of the most hotly contested issues of justice and rights can’t\\nbe debated without taking up controversial moral and religious questions. In deciding how to define the\\nrights and duties of citizens, it’s not always possible to set aside competing conceptions of the good life.\\nAnd even when it’s possible, it may not be desirable.\\nAsking democratic citizens to leave their moral and religious convictions behind when they enter the\\npublic realm may seem a way of ensuring toleration and mutual respect. In practice, however, the\\nopposite can be true. Deciding important public questions while pretending to a neutrality that cannot be\\nachieved is a recipe for backlash and resentment. A politics emptied of substantive moral engagement\\nmakes for an impoverished civic life. It is also an open invitation to narrow, intolerant moralisms.\\nFundamentalists rush in where liberals fear to tread.If our debates about justice unavoidably embroil us in substantive moral questions, it remains to ask\\nhow these arguments can proceed. Is it possible to reason about the good in public without lapsing into\\nwars of religion? What would a more morally engaged public discourse look like, and how would it differ\\nfrom the kind of political argument to which we’ve become accustomed? These are not merely\\nphilosophical questions. They lie at the heart of any attempt to reinvigorate political discourse and\\nrenew our civic life.10. JUSTICE AND THE COMMON GOOD\\nOn September 12, 1960,\\n John F. Kennedy, the Democratic candidate for president, gave a speech in\\nHouston, Texas, on the role of religion in politics. The “religious issue” had dogged his campaign.\\nKennedy was a Catholic, and no Catholic had ever been elected president. Some voters harbored\\nunspoken prejudice; others voiced the fear that Kennedy would be beholden to the Vatican in the\\nconduct of his office or might impose Catholic doctrine on public policy.\\n1\\n Hoping to lay these fears to\\nrest, Kennedy agreed to speak to a gathering of Protestant ministers about the role his religion would\\nplay in his presidency, should he be elected. His answer was simple: none. His religious faith was a\\nprivate matter and would have no bearing on his public responsibilities.\\n“I believe in a president whose religious views are his own private affair,” Kennedy stated. “Whatever\\nissue may come before me as president—on birth control, divorce, censorship, gambling or any other\\nsubject—I will make my decision . . . in accordance with what my conscience tells me to be the national\\ninterest, and without regard to outside religious pressures or dictates.”\\n2\\nKennedy did not say whether or how his conscience might have been shaped by his religious\\nconvictions. But he seemed to suggest that his beliefs about the national interest had little if anything to\\ndo with religion, which he associated with “outside pressures” and “dictates.” \\nHe wanted to reassure the\\nProtestant ministers, and the American public, that he would not impose his religious beliefs—whatever\\nthey might be—on them.\\nThe speech was widely regarded as a political success, and Kennedy went on to win the presidency.\\nTheodore H. White, the great chronicler of presidential campaigns, praised the speech for defining “the\\npersonal doctrine of a modern Catholic in a democratic society.”\\n3\\nForty-six years later, on June 28, 2006, Barack Obama, soon to become a candidate for his party’s\\npresidential nomination, gave a very different speech on the role of religion in politics. He began by\\nrecalling the way he had dealt with the religious issue in his U.S. Senate campaign two years earlier.\\nObama’s opponent, a rather strident religious conservative, had attacked Obama’s support for gay\\nrights and abortion rights by claiming he was not a good Christian, and that Jesus Christ would not have\\nvoted for him.\\n“I answered with what has come to be the typically liberal response in such debates,” Obama said,\\nlooking back. “I said that we live in a pluralistic society, that I can’t impose my own religious views on\\nanother, that I was running to be the U.S. Senator of Illinois and not the Minister of Illinois.”\\n4\\nAlthough Obama easily won the Senate race, he now thought his response had been inadequate, and\\n“did not adequately address the role my faith has in guiding my own values and my own beliefs.”\\n5\\nHe proceeded to describe his own Christian faith and to argue for the relevance of religion to political\\nargument. It was a mistake, he thought, for progressives to “abandon the field of religious discourse” in\\npolitics. “The discomfort of some progressives with any hint of religion has often prevented us from\\neffectively addressing issues in moral terms.” If liberals offered a political discourse emptied of religious\\ncontent, they would “forfeit the imagery and terminology through which millions of Americans understand\\nboth their personal morality and social justice.”\\n6\\nReligion was not only a source of resonant political rhetoric. The solution to certain social problems\\nrequired moral transformation. \\n“Our fear of getting ‘preachy’ may . . . lead us to discount the role that\\nvalues and culture play in some of our most urgent social problems,” Obama said. Addressing problems\\nsuch as “poverty and racism, the uninsured and the unemployed,” would require “changes in hearts and\\na change in minds.”\\n7\\n So it was a mistake to insist that moral and religious convictions play no part in\\npolitics and law.\\nSecularists are wrong when they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before\\nentering into the public square. Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, William Jennings Bryan,\\nDorothy Day, Martin Luther King—indeed, the majority of great reformers in American history—\\nwere not only motivated by faith, but repeatedly used religious language to argue for their\\ncause. So to say that men and women should not inject their “personal morality” into publicpolicy debates is a practical absurdity. Our law is by definition a codification of morality, much\\nof it grounded in the Judeo-Christian tradition.\\n8\\nMany have noted the similarities between John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama. Both were young,\\neloquent, inspiring political figures whose election marked the turn to a new generation of leadership.\\nAnd both sought to rally Americans to a new era of civic engagement. But their views on the role of\\nreligion in politics could hardly be more different.\\nThe Aspiration to Neutrality\\nKennedy’s view of religion as a private, not public, affair reflected more than the need to disarm anti-\\nCatholic prejudice. It reflected a public philosophy that would come to full expression during the 1960s\\nand ’70s—a philosophy that held that government should be neutral on moral and religious questions, so\\nthat each individual could be free to choose his or her own conception of the good life.\\nBoth major political parties appealed to the idea of neutrality, but in different ways. Generally\\nspeaking, Republicans invoked the idea in economic policy, while Democrats applied it to social and\\ncultural issues.\\n9\\n Republicans argued against government intervention in free markets on the grounds\\nthat individuals should be free to make their own economic choices and spend their money as they\\npleased; for government to spend taxpayers’ money or regulate economic activity for public purposes\\nwas to impose a state-sanctioned vision of the common good that not everyone shared. Tax cuts were\\npreferable to government spending, because they left individuals free to decide for themselves what\\nends to pursue and how to spend their own money.\\nDemocrats rejected the notion that free markets are neutral among ends and defended a greater\\nmeasure of government intervention in the economy. But when it came to social and cultural issues,\\nthey, too, invoked the language of neutrality. Government should not “legislate morality” in the areas of\\nsexual behavior or reproductive decisions, they maintained, because to do so imposes on some the\\nmoral and religious convictions of others. Rather than restrict abortion or homosexual intimacies,\\ngovernment should be neutral on these morally charged questions and let individuals choose for\\nthemselves.\\nIn 1971, John Rawls’s \\nA Theory of Justice\\n offered a philosophical defense of the liberal conception of\\nneutrality that Kennedy’s speech had intimated.\\n10\\n In the 1980s, the communitarian critics of liberal\\nneutrality questioned the vision of the freely choosing, unencumbered self that seemed to underlie\\nRawls’s theory. They argued not only for stronger notions of community and solidarity but also for a\\nmore robust public engagement with moral and religious questions.\\n11\\nIn 1993, Rawls published a book, \\nPolitical Liberalism\\n, that recast his theory in some respects. He\\nacknowledged that, in their personal lives, people often have “affections, devotions, and loyalties that\\nthey believe they would not, indeed could and should not, stand apart from. . . . They may regard it as\\nsimply unthinkable to view themselves apart \\nfrom certain religious, philosophical, and moral convictions,\\nor from certain enduring attachments and loyalties.”\\n12\\n To this extent, Rawls accepted the possibility of\\nthickly constituted, morally encumbered selves. But he insisted that such loyalties and attachments\\nshould have no bearing on our identity as citizens. In debating justice and rights, we should set aside\\nour personal moral and religious convictions and argue from the standpoint of a “political conception of\\nthe person,” independent of any particular loyalties, attachments, or conception of the good life.\\n13\\nWhy should we not bring our moral and religious convictions to bear in public discourse about justice\\nand rights? Why should we separate our identity as citizens from our identity as moral persons more\\nbroadly conceived? Rawls argues that we should do so in order to respect “the fact of reasonable\\npluralism” about the good life that prevails in the modern world. People in modern democratic societies\\ndisagree about moral and religious questions; moreover, these disagreements are reasonable. “It is not\\nto be expected that conscientious persons with full powers of reason, even after free discussion, will all\\narrive at the same conclusion.”\\n14\\nAccording to this argument, the case for liberal neutrality arises from the need for tolerance in the\\nface of moral and religious disagreement. “Which moral judgments are true, all things considered, is nota matter for political liberalism,” Rawls writes. To maintain impartiality between competing moral and\\nreligious doctrines, political liberalism does not “address the moral topics on which those doctrines\\ndivide.”\\n15\\nThe demand that we separate our identity as citizens from our moral and religious convictions means\\nthat, when engaging in public discourse about justice and rights, we must abide by the limits of liberal\\npublic reason. Not only may government not endorse a particular conception of the good; citizens may\\nnot even introduce their moral and religious convictions into public debate about justice and rights.\\n16\\nFor if they do, and if their arguments prevail, they will effectively impose \\non their fellow citizens a law\\nthat rests on a particular moral or religious doctrine.\\nHow can we know whether our political arguments meet the requirements of public reason, suitably\\nshorn of any reliance on moral or religious views? Rawls suggests a novel test: “To check whether we\\nare following public reason we might ask: how would our argument strike us presented in the form of a\\nsupreme court opinion?”\\n17\\n As Rawls explains, this is a way to make sure that our arguments are neutral\\nin the sense that liberal public reason requires: “The justices cannot, of course, invoke their own\\npersonal morality, nor the ideals and virtues of morality generally. Those they must view as irrelevant.\\nEqually, they cannot invoke their or other people’s religious or philosophical views.”\\n18\\n When\\nparticipating as citizens in public debate, we should observe a similar restraint. Like Supreme Court\\njustices, we should set aside our moral and religious convictions, and restrict ourselves to arguments\\nthat all citizens can reasonably be expected to accept.\\nThis is the ideal of liberal neutrality that John Kennedy invoked and Barack Obama rejected. From the\\n1960s through the 1980s, Democrats drifted toward the neutrality ideal, and largely banished moral and\\nreligious argument from their political discourse. There were some notable exceptions. Martin Luther\\nKing, Jr., invoked moral and religious arguments in advancing the cause of civil rights; the anti–Vietnam\\nWar movement was energized by moral and religious discourse; and Robert F. Kennedy, seeking the\\nDemocratic presidential nomination in 1968, tried to summon the nation to more demanding moral and\\ncivic ideals. But by the 1970s, liberals embraced the language of neutrality and choice, and ceded moral\\nand religious discourse to the emerging Christian right.\\nWith the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, Christian conservatives became a prominent voice in\\nRepublican politics. Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority and Pat Robertson’s Christian Coalition sought to\\nclothe the “naked public square”\\n19\\n and to combat what they saw as the \\nmoral permissiveness of\\nAmerican life. They favored school prayer, religious displays in public places, and legal restrictions on\\npornography, abortion, and homosexuality. For their part, liberals opposed these policies, not by\\nchallenging the moral judgments case by case, but instead by arguing that moral and religious judgments\\nhave no place in politics.\\nThis pattern of argument served Christian conservatives well, and gave liberalism a bad name. In the\\n1990s and early 2000s, liberals argued, somewhat defensively, that they, too, stood for “values,” by\\nwhich they typically meant the values of tolerance, fairness, and freedom of choice. (In an awkward\\nreach for resonance, 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry used the words \\nvalue\\n or \\nvalues\\nthirty-two times in his convention acceptance speech.) But these were the values associated with\\nliberal neutrality and the constraints of liberal public reason. They did not connect with the moral and\\nspiritual yearning abroad in the land, or answer the aspiration for a public life of larger meaning.\\n20\\nUnlike other Democrats, Barack Obama understood this yearning and gave it political voice. This set\\nhis politics apart from the liberalism of his day. The key to his eloquence was not simply that he was\\nadept with words. It was also that his political language was infused with a moral and spiritual dimension\\nthat pointed beyond liberal neutrality.\\nEach day, it seems, thousands of Americans are going about their daily rounds—dropping off\\nthe kids at school, driving to the office, flying to a business meeting, shopping at the mall, trying\\nto stay on their diets—and they’re coming to realize that something is missing. They are\\ndeciding that their work, their possessions, their diversions, their sheer busyness, is not\\nenough. They want a sense of purpose, a narrative arc to their lives. . . . If we truly hope to\\nspeak to people where they’re at—to communicate our hopes and values in a way that’s\\nrelevant to their own—then as progressives, we cannot abandon the field of religiousdiscourse.\\n21\\nObama’s claim that progressives should embrace a more capacious, faith-friendly form of public\\nreason reflects a sound political instinct. It is also good political philosophy. The attempt to detach\\narguments about justice and rights from arguments about the good life is mistaken for two reasons:\\nFirst, it is not always possible to decide questions of justice and rights without resolving substantive\\nmoral questions; and second, even where it’s possible, it may not be desirable.\\nThe Abortion and Stem Cell Debates\\nConsider two familiar political questions that can’t be resolved without taking a stand on an underlying\\nmoral and religious controversy—abortion and embryonic stem cell research. Some people believe that\\nabortion should be banned because it involves the taking of innocent human life. Others disagree,\\narguing that the law should not take sides in the moral and theological controversy over when human life\\nbegins; since the moral status of the developing fetus is a highly charged moral and religious question,\\nthey argue, government should be neutral on that question, and allow women to decide for themselves\\nwhether to have an abortion.\\nThe second position reflects the familiar liberal argument for abortion rights. It claims to resolve the\\nabortion question on the basis of neutrality and freedom of choice, without entering into the moral and\\nreligious controversy. But this argument does not succeed. For, if it’s true that the developing fetus is\\nmorally equivalent to a child, then abortion is morally equivalent to infanticide. And few would maintain\\nthat government should let parents decide for themselves whether to kill their children. So the “pro-\\nchoice” position in the abortion debate is not really neutral on the underlying moral and theological\\nquestion; it implicitly rests on the assumption that the Catholic Church’s teaching on the moral status of\\nthe fetus—that it is a person from the moment of conception—is false.\\nTo acknowledge this assumption is not to argue for banning abortion. It is simply to acknowledge that\\nneutrality and freedom of choice are not sufficient grounds for affirming a right to abortion. Those who\\nwould defend the right of women to decide for themselves whether to terminate a pregnancy should\\nengage with the argument that the developing fetus is equivalent to a person, and try to show why it is\\nwrong. It is not enough to say that the law should be neutral on moral and religious questions. The case\\nfor permitting abortion is no more neutral than the case for banning it. Both positions presuppose some\\nanswer to the underlying moral and religious controversy.\\nThe same is true of the debate over stem cell research. Those who would ban embryonic stem cell\\nresearch argue that, whatever its medical promise, research that involves the destruction of human\\nembryos is morally impermissible. Many who hold this view believe that personhood begins at\\nconception, so that destroying even an early embryo is morally on a par with killing a child.\\nProponents of embryonic stem cell research reply by pointing to the medical benefits the research\\nmay bring, including possible treatments and cures for diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, and spinal cord\\ninjury. And they argue that science should not be hampered by religious or ideological interference;\\nthose with religious objections should not be allowed to impose their views through laws that would ban\\npromising scientific research.\\nAs with the abortion debate, however, the case for permitting embryonic stem cell research cannot be\\nmade without taking a stand on the moral and religious controversy about when personhood begins. If\\nthe early embryo is morally equivalent to a person, then the opponents of embryonic stem cell research\\nhave a point; even highly promising medical research would not justify dismembering a human person.\\nFew people would say it should be legal to harvest organs from a five-year-old child in order to promote\\nlife-saving research. So the argument for permitting embryonic stem cell research is not neutral on the\\nmoral and religious controversy about when human personhood begins. \\nIt presupposes an answer to\\nthat controversy—namely that the pre-implantation embryo destroyed in the course of embryonic stem\\ncell research is not yet a human being.\\n22\\nWith abortion and embryonic stem cell research, it’s not possible to resolve the legal question without\\ntaking up the underlying moral and religious question. In both cases, neutrality is impossible because the\\nissue is whether the practice in question involves taking the life of a human being. Of course, most\\nmoral and political controversies do not involve matters of life and death. So partisans of liberalneutrality might reply that the abortion and stem cell debates are special cases; except where the\\ndefinition of the human person is at stake, we can resolve arguments about justice and rights without\\ntaking sides in moral and religious controversies.\\nSame-Sex Marriage\\nBut this isn’t true, either. Consider the debate over same-sex marriage. Can you decide whether the\\nstate should recognize same-sex marriage without entering into moral and religious controversies about\\nthe purpose of marriage and the moral status of homosexuality? Some say yes, and argue for same-sex\\nmarriage on liberal, nonjudgmental grounds: whether one personally approves or disapproves of gay and\\nlesbian relationships, individuals should be free to choose their marital partners. To allow heterosexual\\nbut not homosexual couples to get married wrongly discriminates against gay men and lesbians, and\\ndenies them equality before the law.\\nIf this argument is a sufficient basis for according state recognition to same-sex marriage, then the\\nissue can be resolved within the bounds of liberal public reason, without recourse to controversial\\nconceptions of the purpose of marriage and the goods it honors. But the case for same-sex marriage\\ncan’t be made on nonjudgmental grounds. It depends on a certain conception of the telos of marriage—\\nits purpose or point. And, as Aristotle reminds us, to argue about the purpose of a \\nsocial institution is to\\nargue about the virtues it honors and rewards. The debate over same-sex marriage is fundamentally a\\ndebate about whether gay and lesbian unions are worthy of the honor and recognition that, in our\\nsociety, state-sanctioned marriage confers. So the underlying moral question is unavoidable.\\nTo see why this is so, it’s important to bear in mind that a state can take three possible policies\\ntoward marriage, not just two. It can adopt the traditional policy and recognize only marriages between a\\nman and a woman; or it can do what several states have done, and recognize same-sex marriage in the\\nsame way it recognizes marriage between a man and a woman; or it can decline to recognize marriage\\nof any kind, and leave this role to private associations.\\nThese three policies can be summarized as follows:\\n \\n1. Recognize only marriages between a man and a woman.\\n2. Recognize same-sex and opposite-sex marriages.\\n3. Don’t recognize marriage of any kind, but leave this role to private associations.\\n \\nIn addition to marriage laws, states can adopt civil union or domestic partnership laws that grant legal\\nprotections, inheritance rights, hospital visitation rights, and child custody arrangements to unmarried\\ncouples who live together and enter into a legal arrangement. A number of states have made such\\narrangements available to gay and lesbian partners. In 2003, Massachusetts, by a ruling of its Supreme\\nCourt, became the first state to accord legal recognition to same-sex marriage (policy 2). In 2008,\\nCalifornia’s Supreme Court also ruled in favor of a right to same-sex marriage, but a few months after\\nthe ruling, a majority of the electorate overturned that decision in a statewide ballot initiative. In 2009,\\nVermont became the first state to legalize gay marriage by legislation rather than by judicial ruling.\\n23\\nPolicy 3 is purely hypothetical, at least in the United States; no state has thus far renounced the\\nrecognition of marriage as a government \\nfunction. But this policy is nonetheless worth examining, as it\\nsheds light on the arguments for and against same-sex marriage.\\nPolicy 3 is the ideal libertarian solution to the marriage debate. It does not abolish marriage, but it\\ndoes abolish marriage as a state-sanctioned institution. It might best be described as the\\ndisestablishment of marriage.\\n24\\n Just as disestablishing religion means getting rid of an official state\\nchurch (while allowing churches to exist independent of the state), disestablishing marriage would mean\\ngetting rid of marriage as an official state function.\\nThe opinion writer Michael Kinsley defends this policy as a way out of what he sees as a hopelessly\\nirresolvable conflict over marriage. Proponents of gay marriage complain that restricting marriage to\\nheterosexuals is a kind of discrimination. Opponents claim that if the state sanctions gay marriage, it\\ngoes beyond tolerating homosexuality to endorsing it and giving it “a government stamp of approval.”\\nThe solution, Kinsley writes, is “to end the institution of governmentsanctioned marriage,” to “privatizemarriage.”\\n25\\n Let people get married any way they please, without state sanction or interference.\\nLet churches and other religious institutions continue to offer marriage ceremonies. Let\\ndepartment stores and casinos get into the act if they want. . . . Let couples celebrate their\\nunion in any way they choose and consider themselves married whenever they want. . . . And,\\nyes, if three people want to get married, or one person wants to marry herself, and someone\\nelse wants to conduct a ceremony and declare them married, let ’em.\\n26\\n“If marriage were an entirely private affair,” Kinsley reasons, “all the disputes over gay marriage\\nwould become irrelevant. Gay marriage would not have the official sanction of government, but neither\\nwould straight marriage.” Kinsley suggests that domestic partnership laws could deal with the financial,\\ninsurance, child support, and inheritance issues that arise when people co-habit and raise children\\ntogether. He \\nproposes, in effect, to replace all state-sanctioned marriages, gay and straight, with civil\\nunions.\\n27\\nFrom the standpoint of liberal neutrality, Kinsley’s proposal has a clear advantage over the two\\nstandard alternatives (policies 1 and 2): It does not require judges or citizens to engage in the moral and\\nreligious controversy over the purpose of marriage and the morality of homosexuality. Since the state\\nwould no longer confer on any family units the honorific title of marriage, citizens would be able to avoid\\nengaging in debate about the telos of marriage, and whether gays and lesbians can fulfill it.\\nRelatively few people on either side of the same-sex marriage debate have embraced the\\ndisestablishment proposal. But it sheds light on what’s at stake in the existing debate, and helps us see\\nwhy both proponents and opponents of same-sex marriage must contend with the substantive moral and\\nreligious controversy about the purpose of marriage and the goods that define it. Neither of the two\\nstandard positions can be defended within the bounds of liberal public reason.\\nOf course, those who reject same-sex marriage on the grounds that it sanctions sin and dishonors the\\ntrue meaning of marriage aren’t bashful about the fact that they’re making a moral or religious claim. But\\nthose who defend a right to same-sex marriage often try to rest their claim on neutral grounds, and to\\navoid passing judgment on the moral meaning of marriage. The attempt to find a nonjudgmental case for\\nsame-sex marriage draws heavily on the ideas of nondiscrimination and freedom of choice. But these\\nideas cannot by themselves justify a right to same-sex marriage. To see why this is so, consider the\\nthoughtful and nuanced opinion written by Margaret Marshall, chief justice of the Massachusetts\\nSupreme Court, in the court’s ruling in \\nGoodridge v. Dept. of Public Health\\n (2003), the same-sex\\nmarriage case.\\n28\\nMarshall begins by recognizing the deep moral and religious disagreement the subject provokes, and\\nimplies that the court will not take sides in this dispute:\\nMany people hold deep-seated religious, moral, and ethical convictions that marriage should be\\nlimited to the union of one man and one woman, and that homosexual conduct is immoral. Many\\nhold equally strong religious, moral and ethical convictions that same-sex couples are entitled\\nto be married, and that homosexual persons should be treated no differently than their\\nheterosexual neighbors. Neither view answers the question before us. “Our obligation is to\\ndefine the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.”\\n29\\nAs if to avoid entering into the moral and religious controversy over homosexuality, Marshall\\ndescribes the moral issue before the court in liberal terms—as a matter of autonomy and freedom of\\nchoice. The exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage is incompatible with “respect for individual\\nautonomy and equality under law,” she writes.\\n30\\n The liberty of “choosing whether and whom to marry\\nwould be hollow” if the state could “foreclose an individual from freely choosing the person with whom to\\nshare an exclusive commitment.”\\n31\\n The issue, Marshall maintains, is not the moral worth of the choice,\\nbut the right of the individual to make it—that is, the right of the plaintiffs “to marry their chosen\\npartner.”\\n32\\nBut autonomy and freedom of choice are insufficient to justify a right to same-sex marriage. If\\ngovernment were truly neutral on the moral worth of all voluntary intimate relationships, then the statewould have no grounds for limiting marriage to two persons; consensual polygamous partnerships would\\nalso qualify. In fact, if the state really wanted to be neutral, and respect whatever choices individuals\\nwished to make, it would have to adopt Michael Kinsley’s proposal and get out of the business of\\nconferring recognition on any marriages.\\nThe real issue in the gay marriage debate is not freedom of choice but whether same-sex unions are\\nworthy of honor and recognition by the community—whether they fulfill the purpose of the social\\ninstitution \\nof marriage. In Aristotle’s terms, the issue is the just distribution of offices and honors. It’s a\\nmatter of social recognition.\\nNotwithstanding its emphasis on freedom of choice, the Massachusetts court made clear that it did\\nnot intend to open the way to polygamous marriage. It didn’t question the notion that government may\\nconfer social recognition on some intimate associations rather than others. Nor did the court call for the\\nabolition, or disestablishment, of marriage.\\nTo the contrary, Justice Marshall’s opinion offers a paean to marriage as “one of our community’s\\nmost rewarding and cherished institutions.”\\n33\\n It argues that eliminating state-sanctioned marriage\\n“would dismantle a vital organizing principle of our society.”\\n34\\nRather than abolish state-sanctioned marriage, Marshall argues for expanding its traditional definition\\nto include partners of the same sex. In doing so, she steps outside the bounds of liberal neutrality to\\naffirm the moral worth of same-sex unions, and to offer a view about the purpose of marriage, properly\\nconceived. More than a private arrangement between two consenting adults, she observes, marriage is\\na form of public recognition and approval. “In a real sense, there are three partners to every civil\\nmarriage: two willing spouses and an approving State.”\\n35\\n This feature of marriage brings out its\\nhonorific aspect: “Civil marriage is at once a deeply personal commitment to another human being and a\\nhighly public celebration of the ideals of mutuality, companionship, intimacy, fidelity, and family.”\\n36\\nIf marriage is an honorific institution, what virtues does it honor? To ask that question is to ask about\\nthe purpose, or telos, of marriage as a social institution. Many opponents of same-sex marriage claim\\nthat the primary purpose of marriage is procreation. According to this argument, since same-sex couples\\nare unable to procreate on their own, they don’t have a right to marry. They lack, so to speak, the\\nrelevant virtue.\\nThis teleological line of reasoning is at the heart of the case against same-sex marriage, and Marshall\\ntakes it on directly. She does not pretend \\nto be neutral on the purpose of marriage, but offers a rival\\ninterpretation of it. The essence of marriage, she maintains, is not procreation but an exclusive, loving\\ncommitment between two partners—be they straight or gay.\\nNow, how, you might ask, is it possible to adjudicate between rival accounts of the purpose, or\\nessence, of marriage? Is it possible to argue rationally about the meaning and purpose of morally\\ncontested social institutions such as marriage? Or is it simply a clash of bald assertions—some say it’s\\nabout procreation, others say it’s about loving commitment—and there’s no way of showing one to be\\nmore plausible than the other?\\nMarshall’s opinion offers a good illustration of how such arguments can proceed. First, she disputes\\nthe claim that procreation is the primary purpose of marriage. She does so by showing that marriage, as\\ncurrently practiced and regulated by the state, does not require the ability to procreate. Heterosexual\\ncouples who apply for marriage licenses are not asked about “their ability or intention to conceive\\nchildren by coitus. Fertility is not a condition of marriage, nor is it grounds for divorce. People who have\\nnever consummated their marriage, and never plan to, may be and stay married. People who cannot stir\\nfrom their deathbed may marry.” While “many, perhaps most married couples have children together\\n(assisted or unassisted),” Marshall concludes, “it is the exclusive and permanent commitment of the\\nmarriage partners to one another, not the begetting of children, that is the sine qua non of civil\\nmarriage.”\\n37\\nSo part of Marshall’s argument consists of an interpretation of the purpose or essence of marriage as\\nit currently exists. Faced with rival interpretations of a social practice—marriage-as-procreation versus\\nmarriage-as-exclusive-and-permanent-commitment—how can we determine which is more plausible?\\nOne way is to ask which account makes better sense of existing marriage laws, taken as a whole.\\nAnother is to ask which interpretation of marriage celebrates virtues worth honoring. What counts as the\\npurpose of marriage partly depends \\non what qualities we think marriage should celebrate and affirm.\\nThis makes the underlying moral and religious controversy unavoidable: What is the moral status of gayand lesbian relationships?\\nMarshall is not neutral on this question. She argues that same-sex relationships are as worthy of\\nrespect as heterosexual relationships. Restricting marriage to heterosexuals “confers an official stamp\\nof approval on the destructive stereotype that same-sex relationships are inherently unstable and\\ninferior to opposite-sex relationships and are not worthy of respect.”\\n38\\nSo when we look closely at the case for same-sex marriage, we find that it cannot rest on the ideas\\nof nondiscrimination and freedom of choice. In order to decide who should qualify for marriage, we have\\nto think through the purpose of marriage and the virtues it honors. And this carries us onto contested\\nmoral terrain, where we can’t remain neutral toward competing conceptions of the good life.\\nJustice and the Good Life\\nOver the course of this journey, we’ve explored three approaches to justice. One says justice means\\nmaximizing utility or welfare—the greatest happiness for the greatest number. The second says justice\\nmeans respecting freedom of choice—either the actual choices people make in a free market (the\\nlibertarian view) or the hypothetical choices people \\nwould\\n make in an original position of equality (the\\nliberal egalitarian view). The third says justice involves cultivating virtue and reasoning about the\\ncommon good. As you’ve probably guessed by now, I favor a version of the third approach. Let me try\\nto explain why.\\nThe utilitarian approach has two defects: First, it makes justice and rights a matter of calculation, not\\nprinciple. Second, by trying to translate all human goods into a single, uniform measure of value, it\\nflattens them, and takes no account of the qualitative differences among them.\\nThe freedom-based theories solve the first problem but not the second. They take rights seriously and\\ninsist that justice is more than \\nmere calculation. Although they disagree among themselves about \\nwhich\\nrights should outweigh utilitarian considerations, they agree that certain rights are fundamental and must\\nbe respected. But beyond singling out certain rights as worthy of respect, they accept people’s\\npreferences as they are. They don’t require us to question or challenge the preferences and desires we\\nbring to public life. According to these theories, the moral worth of the ends we pursue, the meaning and\\nsignificance of the lives we lead, and the quality and character of the common life we share all lie\\nbeyond the domain of justice.\\nThis seems to me mistaken. A just society can’t be achieved simply by maximizing utility or by\\nsecuring freedom of choice. To achieve a just society we have to reason together about the meaning of\\nthe good life, and to create a public culture hospitable to the disagreements that will inevitably arise.\\nIt is tempting to seek a principle or procedure that could justify, once and for all, whatever distribution\\nof income or power or opportunity resulted from it. Such a principle, if we could find it, would enable us\\nto avoid the tumult and contention that arguments about the good life invariably arouse.\\nBut these arguments are impossible to avoid. Justice is inescapably judgmental. Whether we’re\\narguing about financial bailouts or Purple Hearts, surrogate motherhood or same-sex marriage,\\naffirmative action or military service, CEO pay or the right to use a golf cart, questions of justice are\\nbound up with competing notions of honor and virtue, pride and recognition. Justice is not only about the\\nright way to distribute things. It is also about the right way to value things.\\nA Politics of the Common Good\\nIf a just society involves reasoning together about the good life, it remains to ask what kind of political\\ndiscourse would point us in this direction. I don’t have a fully worked out answer to this question, but I\\ncan offer a few illustrative suggestions. First, an observation: Today, \\nmost of our political arguments\\nrevolve around welfare and freedom—increasing economic output and respecting people’s rights. For\\nmany people, talk of virtue in politics brings to mind religious conservatives telling people how to live.\\nBut this is not the only way that conceptions of virtue and the common good can inform politics. The\\nchallenge is to imagine a politics that takes moral and spiritual questions seriously, but brings them to\\nbear on broad economic and civic concerns, not only on sex and abortion.\\nIn my lifetime, the most promising voice in this direction was that of Robert F. Kennedy, as he soughtthe Democratic presidential nomination in 1968. For him, justice involved more than the size and\\ndistribution of the national product. It was also about higher moral purposes. In a speech at the\\nUniversity of Kansas on March 18, 1968, Kennedy spoke of the war in Vietnam, riots in America’s\\ncities, racial inequality, and the crushing poverty he had witnessed in Mississippi and Appalachia. He\\nthen turned from these explicit matters of justice to argue that Americans had come to value the wrong\\nthings. “Even if we act to erase material poverty,” Kennedy said, “there is another greater task. It is to\\nconfront the poverty of satisfaction . . . that afflicts us all.” Americans had given themselves over to “the\\nmere accumulation of things.”\\n39\\nOur Gross National Product now is over 800 billion dollars a year. But that Gross National\\nProduct counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of\\ncarnage. It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them. It\\ncounts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It\\ncounts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in\\nour cities. It counts . . . the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to\\nour children. Yet the Gross National Product does not allow for the health of our children, the\\nquality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or\\nthe strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our \\npublic debate or the integrity of our public\\nofficials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning,\\nneither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything, in short,\\nexcept that which makes life worthwhile. And it can tell us everything about America except why\\nwe are proud to be Americans.\\n40\\nListening to Kennedy, or reading this passage, you might say that the moral criticism he leveled\\nagainst the self-satisfaction and material preoccupations of his time was independent of his point about\\nthe injustices of poverty, the Vietnam War, and racial discrimination. But he saw them as connected. To\\nreverse these injustices, Kennedy thought it necessary to challenge the complacent way of life he saw\\naround him. He did not hesitate to be judgmental. And yet, by invoking Americans’ pride in their country,\\nhe also, at the same time, appealed to a sense of community.\\nKennedy was assassinated less than three months later. We can only speculate whether the morally\\nresonant politics he intimated would have come to fruition had he lived.\\nFour decades later, during the 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama also tapped Americans’\\nhunger for a public life of larger purpose and articulated a politics of moral and spiritual aspiration.\\nWhether the need to contend with a financial crisis and deep recession will prevent him from turning the\\nmoral and civic thrust of his campaign into a new politics of the common good remains to be seen.\\nWhat might a new politics of the common good look like? Here are some possible themes:\\n1. Citizenship, sacrifice, and service\\nIf a just society requires a strong sense of community, it must find a way to cultivate in citizens a\\nconcern for the whole, a dedication to the common good. It can’t be indifferent to the attitudes and\\ndispositions, \\nthe “habits of the heart,” that citizens bring to public life. It must find a way to lean against\\npurely privatized notions of the good life, and cultivate civic virtue.\\nTraditionally, the public school has been a site of civic education. In some generations, the military\\nhas been another. I’m referring not mainly to the explicit teaching of civic virtue, but to the practical,\\noften inadvertent civic education that takes place when young people from different economic classes,\\nreligious backgrounds, and ethnic communities come together in common institutions.\\nAt a time when many public schools are in a parlous condition and when only a small fraction of\\nAmerican society serves in the military, it is a serious question how a democratic society as vast and\\ndisparate as ours can hope to cultivate the solidarity and sense of mutual responsibility that a just\\nsociety requires. This question has recently reappeared in our political discourse, at least to some\\nextent.\\nDuring the 2008 campaign, Barack Obama observed that the events of September 11, 2001, stirred in\\nAmericans a sense of patriotism and pride, and a new willingness to serve their country. And hecriticized President George W. Bush for not summoning Americans to some form of shared sacrifice.\\n“Instead of a call to service,” Obama said, “we were asked to go shopping. Instead of a call for shared\\nsacrifice, we gave tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans in a time of war for the very first time in our\\nhistory.”\\n41\\nObama proposed to encourage national service by offering students help with college tuition in\\nexchange for one hundred hours of public service. “You invest in America, and America invests in you,”\\nhe told young people as he campaigned across the country. The proposal proved to be one of his most\\npopular, and in April 2009, he signed legislation to expand the AmeriCorps public service program and\\nprovide college money for students who volunteered in their communities. Despite the resonance of\\nObama’s call to national service, however, more ambitious proposals for mandatory national service\\nhave not found their way onto the political agenda.\\n2. The moral limits of markets\\nOne of the most striking tendencies of our time is the expansion of markets and market-oriented\\nreasoning into spheres of life traditionally governed by non-market norms. In earlier chapters, we\\nconsider the moral questions that arise, for example, when countries hire out military service and the\\ninterrogation of prisoners to mercenaries or private contractors; or when parents outsource pregnancy\\nand child-bearing to paid laborers in the developing world; or when people buy and sell kidneys on the\\nopen market. Other instances abound: Should students in underperforming schools be offered cash\\npayments for scoring well on standardized tests? Should teachers be given bonuses for improving the\\ntest results of their students? Should states hire for-profit prison companies to house their inmates?\\nShould the United States simplify its immigration policy by adopting the proposal of a University of\\nChicago economist to sell U.S. citizenship for a $100,000 fee?\\n42\\nThese questions are not only about utility and consent. They are also about the right ways of valuing\\nkey social practices—military service, child-bearing, teaching and learning, criminal punishment, the\\nadmission of new citizens, and so on. Since marketizing social practices may corrupt or degrade the\\nnorms that define them, we need to ask what non-market norms we want to protect from market\\nintrusion. This is a question that requires public debate about competing conceptions of the right way of\\nvaluing goods. Markets are useful instruments for organizing productive activity. But unless we want to\\nlet the market rewrite the norms that govern social institutions, we need a public debate about the moral\\nlimits of markets.\\n3. Inequality, solidarity, and civic virtue\\nWithin the United States, the gap between rich and poor has grown in recent decades, reaching levels\\nnot seen since the 1930s. Yet inequality has not loomed large as a political issue. Even Barack\\nObama’s modest \\nproposal to return income tax rates to where they stood in the 1990s prompted his\\n2008 Republican opponents to call him a socialist who wanted to spread the wealth.\\nThe dearth of attention to inequality in contemporary politics does not reflect any lack of attention to\\nthe topic among political philosophers. The just distribution of income and wealth has been a mainstay of\\ndebate within political philosophy from the 1970s to the present. But the tendency of philosophers to\\nframe the question in terms of utility or consent leads them to overlook the argument against inequality\\nmost likely to receive a political hearing and most central to the project of moral and civic renewal.\\nSome philosophers who would tax the rich to help the poor argue in the name of utility; taking a\\nhundred dollars from a rich person and giving it to a poor person will diminish the rich person’s\\nhappiness only slightly, they speculate, but greatly increase the happiness of the poor person. John\\nRawls also defends redistribution, but on the grounds of hypothetical consent. He argues that if we\\nimagined a hypothetical social contract in an original position of equality, everyone would agree to a\\nprinciple that would support some form of redistribution.\\nBut there is a third, more important reason to worry about the growing inequality of American life: Too\\ngreat a gap between rich and poor undermines the solidarity that democratic citizenship requires. Here’s\\nhow: As inequality deepens, rich and poor live increasingly separate lives. The affluent send theirchildren to private schools (or to public schools in wealthy suburbs), leaving urban public schools to the\\nchildren of families who have no alternative. A similar trend leads to the secession by the privileged from\\nother public institutions and facilities.\\n43\\n Private health clubs replace municipal recreation centers and\\nswimming pools. Upscale residential communities hire private security guards and rely less on public\\npolice protection. A second or third car removes the need to rely on public transportation. And so on.\\nThe affluent secede from public places and services, leaving them to those who can’t afford anything\\nelse.\\nThis has two bad effects, one fiscal, the other civic. First, public services deteriorate, as those who\\nno longer use those services become less willing to support them with their taxes. Second, public\\ninstitutions such as schools, parks, playgrounds, and community centers cease to be places where\\ncitizens from different walks of life encounter one another. Institutions that once gathered people\\ntogether and served as informal schools of civic virtue become few and far between. The hollowing out\\nof the public realm makes it difficult to cultivate the solidarity and sense of community on which\\ndemocratic citizenship depends.\\nSo, quite apart from its effects on utility or consent, inequality can be corrosive to civic virtue.\\nConservatives enamored of markets and liberals concerned with redistribution overlook this loss.\\nIf the erosion of the public realm is the problem, what is the solution? A politics of the common good\\nwould take as one of its primary goals the reconstruction of the infrastructure of civic life. Rather than\\nfocus on redistribution for the sake of broadening access to private consumption, it would tax the\\naffluent to rebuild public institutions and services so that rich and poor alike would want to take\\nadvantage of them.\\nAn earlier generation made a massive investment in the federal highway program, which gave\\nAmericans unprecedented individual mobility and freedom, but also contributed to the reliance on the\\nprivate automobile, suburban sprawl, environmental degradation, and living patterns corrosive to\\ncommunity. This generation could commit itself to an equally consequential investment in an\\ninfrastructure for civic renewal: public schools to which rich and poor alike would want to send their\\nchildren; public transportation systems reliable enough to attract upscale commuters; and public health\\nclinics, playgrounds, parks, recreation centers, libraries, and museums that would, ideally at least, draw\\npeople out of their gated communities and into the common spaces of a shared democratic citizenship.\\nFocusing on the civic consequences of inequality, and ways of reversing them, might find political\\ntraction that arguments about \\nincome distribution as such do not. It would also help highlight the\\nconnection between distributive justice and the common good.\\n4. A politics of moral engagement\\nSome consider public engagement with questions of the good life to be a civic transgression, a journey\\nbeyond the bounds of liberal public reason. Politics and law should not become entangled in moral and\\nreligious disputes, we often think, for such entanglement opens the way to coercion and intolerance.\\nThis is a legitimate worry. Citizens of pluralist societies do disagree about morality and religion. Even if,\\nas I’ve argued, it’s not possible for government to be neutral on these disagreements, is it nonetheless\\npossible to conduct our politics on the basis of mutual respect?\\nThe answer, I think, is yes. But we need a more robust and engaged civic life than the one to which\\nwe’ve become accustomed. In recent decades, we’ve come to assume that respecting our fellow\\ncitizens’ moral and religious convictions means ignoring them (for political purposes, at least), leaving\\nthem undisturbed, and conducting our public life—insofar as possible—without reference to them. But\\nthis stance of avoidance can make for a spurious respect. Often, it means suppressing moral\\ndisagreement rather than actually avoiding it. This can provoke backlash and resentment. It can also\\nmake for an impoverished public discourse, lurching from one news cycle to the next, preoccupied with\\nthe scandalous, the sensational, and the trivial.\\nA more robust public engagement with our moral disagreements could provide a stronger, not a\\nweaker, basis for mutual respect. Rather than avoid the moral and religious convictions that our fellow\\ncitizens bring to public life, we should attend to them more directly—sometimes by challenging and\\ncontesting them, sometimes by listening to and learning from them. There is no guarantee that public\\ndeliberation about hard moral questions will lead in any given situation to agreement—or even toappreciation for the moral and religious views of others. It’s \\nalways possible that learning more about a\\nmoral or religious doctrine will lead us to like it less. But we cannot know until we try.\\nA politics of moral engagement is not only a more inspiring ideal than a politics of avoidance. It is also\\na more promising basis for a just society.'"
