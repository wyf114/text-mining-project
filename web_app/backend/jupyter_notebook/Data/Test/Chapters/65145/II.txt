BIOLOGY AND SOCIOLOGY


                        PROGRESS

     The Crab to Cancer junior gave advice:
       “Know what you want, my son, and then proceed
       Directly sideways. God has thus decreed--
     Progress is lateral; let that suffice.”

     Darwinian Tapeworms on the other hand
       Agree that Progress is a loss of brain,
       And all that makes it hard for worms to attain
     The true Nirvana--peptic, pure, and grand.

     Man too enjoys to omphaloscopize.
       Himself as Navel of the Universe
       Oft rivets him--until he asks his Nurse,
     Old Nature, for the truth; and she replies:
     “Look back, and find support; you march with Life’s main stream.
     Look on--be proud; her future lies within your dream.”

     LONDON, _Feb. 1923_.




BIOLOGY AND SOCIOLOGY

     “Come out into the light of things;
     Let Nature be your teacher.”
                      --W. WORDSWORTH.


     “In matters that really interest him, man cannot support the
     suspense of judgment which science so often has to enjoin. He is
     too anxious to feel certain to have time to know. So that we see
     of the sciences, mathematics appearing first, then astronomy,
     then physics, then chemistry, then biology, then psychology,
     then sociology--but always the new field was grudged to the new
     method, and we still have the denial to sociology of the name of
     science.”--W. TROTTER, _Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War_.


There are many facile comparisons to be drawn between the facts of
biology and of sociology. The most obvious is that between a whole
civilized community and one of the higher animals. Shakespeare
employed an age-old fable in Menenius Agrippa’s Tale of the Belly
and the Members in _Coriolanus_. With Darwin, and the establishment
of evolutionary biology on a sound footing, matters took a new turn.
Man was now seen to be connected with the rest of life not merely by
analogies of his own mind’s weaving, but by the living bonds of genetic
descent; and it was at once perceived that a more rigid force than had
hitherto been suspected might inhere in the comparisons between State
and Organism. For, as Spencer argued, was not the State in a true sense
an organism--a single biological unit composed of individual human
beings just as a metazoan animal was a single biological unit composed,
in the first instance, of individual cells? Further, the investigation
of the evolutionary process seemed to reveal certain general laws of
its march: beings of the same original constitution, exposed to the
environmental forces of the same planet, had reacted in similar ways,
developing along parallel lines, and arriving at similar types of
organization as end-result. Thus it might reasonably be supposed that
we should find the same general organization and mode of development in
one type of organism as in another, in human society as in a vertebrate.

On these bases, Spencer and his followers drew elaborate comparisons
of the two, and apparently believed that they were reaching the
same degree of accuracy as that found in comparative anatomy when
they compared the circulatory system of a mammal with the transport
facilities of a State, or drew parallels between the brain and the
cabinet.

It was speedily seen, however, that such generalizations were so broad
and vague as not to be of much service: that the resemblances were in
fact often no more than symbolical or metaphorical, instead of being
based upon detailed similarity of constitution or of evolutionary
development. With this, evolutionary theorizing on sociological
matters fell somewhat into disrepute. The earlier jubilant certainty
gave place to later doubt; and the half-century whose beginnings had
roused Haeckel and Herbert Spencer to their imaginative flights closed
suitably enough with that remarkable document, T. H. Huxley’s Romanes
Lecture, in which the greatest protagonist of Darwinism confesses
to seeing between man and the rest of the cosmic process, in spite
of man’s genesis from that same cosmic process, an insuperable and
essential opposition, a difference of aim or direction which had turned
the original bridge into a barrier.[18]

As a result, not only did the particular comparison between society
and an organism fall into disrepute, but also all attempts to draw
far-reaching conclusions from biology to human affairs.

But the original contention still remains, and is logically
unassailable. Man is an organism descended from lower organisms; his
communities are composed of units bound together for mutual good in
a division of labour in the same way as are the cells of a metazoan:
he can no more escape the effects of his terrestrial environment than
can other organisms. There _is_ therefore reason to suppose that the
processes of evolution in man and man’s societies on the one hand, and
in lower organisms on the other, must have something important and
indeed fundamental in common, something which if we could but unravel
would help us in the study of both.

The correlation of biology with sociology is important not only in
itself, but also as part of a more general correlation of all the
sciences. The correlation of the sciences is of particular importance
to-day for a double set of reasons. The rise of evolutionary biology
and of modern psychology have not only changed our outlook on specially
human problems, but have altered the whole balance, if I may so put
it, of science. There was a time when the basic studies of physics
and chemistry seemed not only basic but somehow more essentially
scientific than the sciences dealing with life. Distinctions were
drawn between the experimental and the observational sciences--often
half-consciously implying a distinction between accurate, scientific,
self-respecting sciences and blundering, hit-or-miss, tolerated bodies
of knowledge. Biological phenomena are now, however, seen to be every
whit as susceptible of accurate and experimental analysis; and indeed
to present so many problems to the physicist and chemist that in fifty
years or so, I venture to prophesy, the wise virgins in those basic
sciences will be those who have laid in a store of biological oil.

But the main point is this--the study of evolution, of animal behaviour
and of human psychology makes it clear that in the higher forms of
animals at least we are dealing with a category not touched on at all
by the physicist and chemist--the category of mind and mental process.
Sir Charles Sherrington, with admirable lucidity, drew for us, in his
recent address to the British Association, the problem of the relation
between mind and matter as it presents itself to the biologist.

The great change that has come over science in the last half century,
or so it seems to me, is the recognition that mind is not to be
explained away as a mere epiphenomenon, but is to be studied as a
phenomenon. From this point of view, biology will always be the
connecting link between physico-chemical science on the one hand, and
psychology on the other. There is every reason to suppose and no reason
to doubt that life, which we know to be composed of the same material
elements and to work by the same energy as non-living matter, actually
arose from it during the evolution of this planet. There is, in the
behaviour of the lower organisms, nothing which by itself would make us
postulate mind: but in the higher insects, molluscs, and vertebrates,
the last in particular, mental process is not only clearly present, but
clearly of great biological importance; and finally the mind of man,
according to innumerable converging lines of evidence, has evolved from
the mind of some non-human mammal.

The principle of continuity makes us postulate that this new category
of phenomena has not sprung up during the course of evolution
absolutely _de novo_, but that it is in some sense universally present
in all phenomena. It is merely that we have not yet found a method
for the direct detection of mental processes as we have, say, for
electrical processes; but something of the same general nature, the
same category as mind must, if we wish to preserve our scientific
sanity, our belief in the orderliness of the world, be present in lower
organisms and in the lifeless matter from which they originally sprang.

In the present state of our knowledge, the study of physics and
chemistry can be pursued without any reference to mental processes. But
the study of biology cannot: and that is one reason why the centre of
gravity of science as a whole is shifting--it is shifting for exactly
the same reason that the centre of gravity of a house shifts during its
construction--because the foundations have to be built first.

Our second reason is as follows. Biology is once more the link between
root and flower, between physics and chemistry and human affairs, in
regard to evolution. I say evolution: it would be better to broaden the
idea by saying the directional processes to be seen in the universe. So
far as a main direction is to be observed in physics and chemistry, it
is, as all authorities are agreed, towards the degradation of energy
and a final state in which not only life but all activity whatsoever
will be reduced to nothing, all the waters of energy run down into
a single dead level of moveless ocean. Biology, on the other hand,
presents us with the spectacle of an evolution in which the main
direction is the raising of the maximum level of certain qualities
of living beings, such as efficiency of organs, co-ordination, size,
accuracy and range of senses, capacity for knowledge, memory and
educability, emotional intensity,--qualities which in one way or
another lead to a more efficient control by the organism over the
external world, and to its greater independence.

A direction towards more mind is visible; and this development of
greater mental powers has been in all the later stages the chief
instrument of acquiring control and independence. More and more
of matter is embodied in living organisms, more and more becomes
subservient to life.

Thus, while in physics and chemistry we see a tendency towards the
extinction of life and activity, in biology we see a tendency towards
more life and more activity; and this latter tendency is accompanied
and largely made possible by the evolution of greater intensity of
mental process--of something, that is to say, of which we cannot as yet
take account in physics and chemistry.

The biologist may well ask himself the question--“Is it not possible
that this evolving mind, of whose achievements on its new level in
man we are only seeing the beginning, may continue to find more and
more ways of subordinating the inorganic to itself, and that it may
eventually retard or even prevent the attainment of this complete
degradation of energy prophesied by physico-chemical science? Is it
not possible that this great generalization only applies to phenomena
in their purely material aspect, and that when we learn to detect and
measure the mental aspects of phenomena we may find reason to modify
the universal applicability of this law of degradation?” We do not know
the answer to that question: but it is clearly a legitimate and useful
question to ask. In any event, we constatate two chief directions in
the universe; that seen in biology is in many ways opposed to that seen
in physics and chemistry; and both must be taken into account.

I have spent, I fear, a great deal of time on what will appear to many
as very irrelevant prolegomena. But the complete breakdown of the
older views about nature and man, of the philosophies and theologies
based not on observation but on an authority which is no authority, on
unverifiable speculation, on superstition, and on what we would like to
be so rather than on what happens to be so--the breakdown of all the
commonly accepted basis for man’s view of himself and the universe, has
made it necessary to go back to fundamentals if we are to see where
we stand. Secondly, the progress of the biological and psychological
sciences, as I have already pointed out, has considerably altered the
outlook of those who pin their faith to the newer or scientific view
of nature, the view which attempts constantly to refer speculations
to reality, and to build on foundations which have been tested by
experiment.

The orthodox evolutionary view was that phenomena received in some
degree an explanation if their origin from simpler phenomena could be
demonstrated. As a matter of fact, reflection makes it clear that such
an explanation is never complete. It is a very incomplete explanation
of the properties of water to discover that it is composed of oxygen
and hydrogen; or of those of humanity to discover that it is derived
from lower forms of life. A precisely similar mistake is made by most
psycho-analysts, who consider that an “explanation” of adult psychology
is given by tracing in it effects of the events of childhood. In all
such cases it is true that analysis is helped, but we are by no means
exempted from further study of the later (and more complex) phenomena
in and for themselves. Just as adult psychology is qualitatively
different in various respects from childish psychology, so is man
qualitatively different from lower organisms. Very few attempts have
been made to carry over conceptions derived from sociology into
biology.[19] But the converse, as we have seen, has often been true,
and numerous writers--largely because purely biological are simpler
than human phenomena--have been obsessed with the idea that the study
of biology as such will teach us principles which can be applied
directly and wholesale to human problems.

What we have just been saying shows us the correct path. Through
psychology and biology, sociology can become attached to the general
body of science; and in so doing it can both receive and give. Since
man is but a single species of organism, and, biologically speaking,
a very young one; since moreover he presents a peculiar type of
organization, it is clear that the broad principles underlying
physiology and evolution can best be studied on other organisms and
later applied to man. On the other hand, man is the highest existing
organism; thus a study of the causes to which he owes his pre-eminence
will be important as adding to and crowning the principles derived
from non-human biology. Furthermore, not only are man’s mental powers
on a different level from those of other animals, but psychology can
at present make by far its greatest contributions by a study of human
mind, so that the psychological side of biology will for the present
derive its chief information from man.

Our first affair, therefore, is to see in what important respects
man is qualitatively unlike the rest of the organic world; then to
investigate what general rules or principles apply equally to him and
to the others; and finally to see what corrections, so to speak, must
be made before these principles can be applied to the one or to the
other.

The qualitative difference between man and other organisms is a
cardinal fact with orthodox biology has tended to slur over or to
neglect, whereas philosophy has too often tried to magnify it unduly
so as to make man frankly incommensurable with his lower relatives, a
creature not only unique but disparate.

Man is obviously and undoubtedly an organism of the same general nature
as other organisms. He possesses the same general system of organs,
working in the same way as a dog, a horse, a bird, a crocodile, or
a frog; he passes through the same type of developmental cycle; he
is built on the same detailed plan as other mammals; and numerous
indications betray his descent from a particular branch of the
mammalian stock.

But in his mode of life and type of social organization he is unique.
All detailed comparisons between the communities of man and those of
bees and ants are as unprofitable in the working-out as they are easy
in the making. It is futile to direct the sluggard or any other human
being to the ant, since the whole physical and psychical construction
of ants is different from that of man, the whole organization of their
communities from that of his.

His mode of life is unique because his psycho-neural mechanism is built
on a new plan, new modes of connection between parts of the brain being
associated with new possibilities of mind. Let us briefly run over the
biologically most important points in which he differs from the lower
organisms.

In the first place, he is capable of speech, and possesses a true
language--not a mere repertory of sounds or signs associated with
different states of mind, as in some higher organisms, but a language
comprising special symbols for particular external objects, and
thus making it possible to have a much more detailed knowledge and
classification of the outer world. In the second place, he can frame
abstract ideas or concepts, and is thus enabled to extract the general
kernel from the husk of innumerable separate and different particulars.
As a result of these two faculties, he possesses what we may call a
new, accessory form of inheritance. True biological inheritance takes
place by means of the reproductive cells. In some birds and mammals,
the behaviour of the young is modified by what they learn from their
parents, so that they profit by the experience of their elders;
however, this profiting by experience is not cumulative, but must be
repeated afresh in each generation. In man, on the other hand, speech
and writing make it possible to construct a continuous tradition, by
means of which experience may be actually accumulated from generation
to generation. There are thus two forms of inheritance in man, two
hereditary streams--biological inheritance, by means of germ-cells or
detached portions of the organism, in which favourable mutations may
be accumulated by selection, and “experience-inheritance,” by means
of tradition, in which useful experience may be accumulated by the
activity of mind. By means of tradition-inheritance, man is virtually
enabled to “inherit acquired characters”; thus the environment in
which the latter stages of his development are passed through, and
consequently his adult self, the end-product of that development, can
be altered far more rapidly than in any other organism. Finally, it
is possible, as is being increasingly realized, thus to accumulate
experience relating to the alteration of biological inheritance, and so
eventually to substitute conscious purpose for blind natural selection
in man’s future evolution.

Next point: by means of speech, tradition, and invention, man has
been enabled to extend his biological environment--in other words,
that part of the cosmos with which he stands in relation--till it has
reached an enormously greater size than that of any other organism.
He is learning ever more facts about the celestial bodies, studying
stars that are at an inconceivable distance from him. He is able to
travel at will to all parts of the globe. He can penetrate by means of
tradition to remote periods of the past: as Mr. Wells has forcibly put
it, a modern Englishman can know more of the world in the Classical
Epoch than could the most learned Greek or Roman. And even when he can
no more get into contact with ideas, he can still unravel facts: flint
implements help him to the history of man, fossils to that of life,
rocks to that of the globe, stars to that of the solar system. In time,
as well as in space, his environment enlarges to a size that is for
practical purposes infinite, whereas no other organism can penetrate
beyond its own memories, or, at most, do more than profit by those
of the generation immediately before it. Professor Keyser,[20] in a
suggestive article, has characterized this unique attribute of man by
calling him “the time-binder.”

Speech and reasoning, with all their consequences, have only been
rendered possible through another important qualitative change in the
human brain, which in its turn has led to other new potentialities of
life being realized in man and in man alone--its flexibility.

In some of the lowest forms of life, such as Paramecium, there are but
one or two possible modes of reaction--reactions which it attempts in
response to any one of the myriad changes that may occur in the outer
world. As we ascend the scale, we find two chief types of alterations:
in the first place an increase in the number of hereditarily-given
modes of reaction, and in the second an increased power of “learning,”
of altering behaviour in adjustment to experience. In the insects, the
first is chiefly in evidence. Although many insects undoubtedly can
profit by experience to a limited degree, yet most of their behaviour
is instinctive, in the sense that it unrolls itself automatically and
efficiently in the absence of previous experience or of any possible
instruction. In the vertebrates, on the other hand, we see as we pass
from the lower to the higher groups a definite, steady increase in the
power of learning by experience, from the fish that takes weeks to
associate a given colour with a given event such as feeding-time, to
the dog or monkey capable of learning elaborate tricks after a couple
of trials. But even in the most “intelligent” of birds or mammals, the
power of image-formation is very probably absent,[21] and the power
of concept-formation, of generalizing, certainly so. This fact (quite
apart from the absence of tradition, although this too operates in the
same direction) means that the associations of animals can only be
arbitrary and individual: a rook in one country (to choose a somewhat
far-fetched example) may happen to associate danger with fire-arms, one
in another with bows and arrows. Life, for the animals, is a cinema,
different for each individual, in which one event may be associated
with another in the most diverse and haphazard ways. With the advent
of the human type of brain, however, experience can be sorted out and
properly docketed; the mere cinematographic record is converted into a
drama full of significance, the diary into a card-index. By this means,
and by tradition, it is possible for man to obtain a much more accurate
and more complete grasp of the relationships of the objects that
compose the outer world than is possible for any other animal. Through
knowledge, as ever, comes power: and as a result, man has been enabled
to invent tools and machinery, and so to enlarge enormously his control
over his environment. Just as his “range,” in the zoogeographical
sense, is extended to an unprecedented degree both in space and time,
so tools represent, biologically speaking, an extension of himself
as an operator. While man is using a tool, he and the tool together
constitute but a single unit in the struggle for existence. As various
writers have put it, tools and machines are temporary organs of man,
which have the additional merit of being replaceable if lost or damaged.

But this is not all: the great power of association possessed by man,
together with his faculty of generalization and of speech, makes it
possible for him to _learn_ his rôle in the community, instead of being
born with it as are the bee and the ant. Great educability instead of
differentiated instinct, infinite possibility, at the expense of the
pains of learning, instead of an effortless but limited stock of inborn
modes of behaviour--in this again man represents a qualitatively new
organic type.

By this means he can escape what has always been a necessity with lower
forms: by means of education and machinery he can play a specialized
part in the community life, and so build up a community with a high
degree of division of labour, without being born specialized. He could
not thus learn his rôle if he were not educable, nor if he could not
manufacture tools. An ant or a duck or a dog possesses admirable tools
for its particular job: but they are living parts of the organism’s
own body. A worker ant cannot lay down its serviceable carpentering
mandibles and become a soldier by picking up a large and warlike
pair:--once a worker, always a worker; once a soldier, always a
soldier--that is the rule for ants, but not for men.

The efficiency and biological success of communities depends on the
degree and accuracy of the division of labour and co-ordination between
the units of which they are built up. This is true of cell-communities
and the second-grade individuals or metazoa or multicellular animals
and plants to which they give rise,[22] and also of the communities
of metazoa and the third-grade individuals to which they give rise,
whether the members of such communities of higher grade are physically
bound together, as in a Hydroid or a Portuguese Man-o’-War, or
united only by mental bonds, as are the communities of ants and bees
and termites. As we have seen, the individuals are differentiated
structurally for the different functions which they have to perform.

This is not so in human species: a man is not born cross-legged to
be a tailor, or broad-thumbed to be a miller, or big-armed to be a
blacksmith. Even in the hereditary castes of India, the trade or
profession is determined by tradition, and not by inborn structural
adaptations.

Still another consequence flows from this educability, this flexible
and elastic mental organization. A man can pass from one occupation
to another. He can be specialized for several, or combine a high
degree of professional skill in one with the generalized knowledge of
an amateur in another. It is this obvious but fundamental fact which
is at the bottom of many of the failures to apply biological ideas to
sociology.

Another human distinction is the increase of the part played by
environment in man as opposed to animals (in determining his
biologically effective nature). Environment plays not merely a large
part, but a preponderating one, in his development after the first
year or so of his life. Tradition provides a special environment,
made by man for man’s own development; and men brought up in markedly
different traditions arrive at different end-results just as surely and
obviously as do men of markedly different hereditary tendencies arrive
at different end-results even though exposed to similar traditions.
Traditions are infinitely complex things: there are world traditions,
national traditions broad and narrow, class traditions and traditions
of profession and trade, traditions of predilection, of art, of
religion: and men may be exposed in their development to the combined
influence of a number of these. But the net result of the diversity of
tradition is an extraordinary diversity of end-result. “_Nihil humanum
alienum a me puto_”--Terence could only say this with truth in the
sense that there are certain fundamental emotions and instincts found
in all men, and also certain aspects of environment shared by all
humanity--the sun and moon, earth, water, and fire, space and time,
parents and society, and so on and so forth.

I make no apologies for the length of this preliminary analysis,
since it is precisely by the neglect of preliminary analysis that
most attempts to correlate biology and sociology have failed. The
salient fact emerges that with man there has been a radical change in
evolutionary method.

As space is limited, I am here only proposing to consider three of the
chief contributions which biology can make to sociology--on the idea of
progress, on the relation between individual and community, and on the
applicability of the doctrine of the struggle for existence to man.

As regards the idea of progress, biology can make a clear and
unequivocal contribution: whereas man is biologically so young, his
evolution is yet so chaotic and divergently directed, that it is very
hard to arrive at definite conclusions from the study of his history
alone. It has been a source of constant surprise to me that more use
has not been made of biological data in the controversy over this
question. In the little book recently edited by Mr. Marvin on various
aspects of the concept of Progress, there was no article dealing with
biological progress; and even in Professor Bury’s notable book, _The
Idea of Progress_, biology was as little and as unsatisfactorily drawn
upon as in Dean Inge’s writings on the subject.

We have already seen that a certain direction obtains in organic
evolution. Into the details of this process I have not here the time
to go; we must be content with the brief enumeration which has already
been given of the qualities of organisms whose maximum level, and to a
lesser degree whose average, have increased during evolution.

So far so good. But a process may be going in a definite direction and
yet not be satisfactory.

This road leads to London; this other to Puddlington Parva. We all know
people who are obviously headed for success, while it is on record that
Mr. Mantalini’s direction was towards “the demnition bow-wows.”

But we know that we ourselves consciously find _value_ in things, in
objects and aims, in directions and processes. In this we are unique
among organisms, and as a matter of fact a large part of our life is
determined by the relative values we set on objects. On the whole,
however, there is a reasonable amount of agreement among different
individuals, at any rate in one country at one epoch, as to what they
call good and what they call bad. There are very few western Europeans
who find dirt or untruthfulness good, knowledge or bravery bad.

When we look into the trend of biological evolution, we find as a
matter of fact that it has operated to produce on the whole what we
find good, to bring into being more and more things on which we can set
positive value. This is not to say that progress is an inevitable “law
of nature,” but that it has actually occurred, and that its occurrence
provides an external sanction for many of our subjective human hopes
and ideals.

True that we are ourselves a product of the evolutionary process and
might therefore be thought biased. None the less, it is clear that if a
degenerate animal like a tapeworm, or one inevitably specialized like
a hermit-crab, could possess and enunciate values, they would be of a
very different nature from our own. But we should further find that
the direction of the evolutionary process which led to the former was
directly opposed to the main trend, that of the latter more or less
at right angles to it. The general coincidence of the main observable
trend and of our own concepts of value warrants us in calling the one
progressive, and in feeling that the other is no mere isolated flicker
in an alien or hostile world, but finds a sanction and a resting-place
in being part of something vastly bigger than itself. The remarkable
and important fact for man is to find, in spite of all the apparently
fundamental differences between his organization and his evolutionary
methods and those of lower organisms, in spite of the widespread
degeneration and “blind-alleyism” to be seen in evolution, that the
direction in which he desires to go coincides with the resultant, the
main direction of organic evolution. There are no ideals, there is no
purpose, in fish or ant or tree: but man’s ideals and purposes are the
outcome of the blind interplay of forces in which fish and ant and
tree play their unwitting rôles. True again that further analysis shows
that the methods of evolutionary progress are often crude, wasteful,
and slow: that some of our values are unreal or artificial: but this
does not destroy the main fact, and only means that each side can here
learn something from the other.

The main fact abides--that progress is an evolutionary reality, and
that an analysis of the modes of biological progress may often help us
in our quest for human progress.

The next great problem on which biology has something to say to
sociology is that eternal one of the relation between individual
and community. As it is sometimes put, Does the individual exist
for the State, or the State for the individual? In all non-human
biological aggregates--cell-colonies, second-grade aggregates or
metazoan organisms, third-grade aggregates like Siphonophora and
insect communities--the very existence of the aggregate as a unit, its
biological efficiency and success, depend upon a permanent division of
labour between its members, upon their thoroughgoing specialization.
This always and inevitably involves a sacrifice of certain of their
potentialities to greater efficiency in one of a few actual functions,
and in evolution a progressive subordination of the smaller unit to the
aggregate.

At first sight, biological principles seem to contradict themselves
on this subject. On the one hand, the human individual is, or, we had
better say, has the potentiality of being the highest type of organism
in existence--far higher, biologically speaking, not only than any
human community now in existence, but than any which we could possibly
imagine as coming into existence in the future. When we remember the
general agreement of biological progress with our human values, it is
clear that to degrade the individual for the benefit of the community
is wrong--a biological crime.

On the other hand, human progress depends and will always depend to an
extent scarcely to be overrated upon the proper organization of the
community. So long as present competition continues, the very survival
of a nation may easily depend upon the efficiency of its organization
as a community. Biological as well as human experience makes it
perfectly plain that such success, in a unit which is itself an
aggregate of smaller units, depends upon the degree of specialization
of these constituent units and the division of labour and co-operation
between them.

Biology here then lays down that human individuals should become
more and more specialized if progress is to continue; but since
specialization implies the sacrifice of many potentialities for the
good of the whole, this apparently contradicts what we have just
inculcated above.

This is where our human flexibility comes in. Man should neither live
whole-heartedly for himself, nor throw his individuality, ant-like,
beneath the wheels of the community Juggernaut. He can escape from the
dilemma by passing from one state to the other. For part of his time,
he can apply his energies as a specialized unit--for the rest, he can
be a complete individual, realizing the various potentialities of his
many-sided nature, with the community contributing to his development,
not he to the community’s. And not only can he, but he should act thus.

Be it noted, to avoid misapprehension, that I have here been using the
community to denote the single aggregate unit which from the beginning
has played such an important part biologically in human evolution, not
merely as denoting the sum of individuals considered separately.

Thus biology gives a definite answer to this question too. Pure
individualism is condemned, and so is what we may call ant-and-bee
socialism. Some form of the “dual day,” to use a current phrase, or at
least of the “dual life,” is the method which seems to be in accord
with the enduring principles of biology, although the precise details
are not and cannot be the biologist’s concern, and particular lives,
such as that of the creative artist, who moves on a different plane of
reality, escape his analysis.

I have reserved to the close that biological principle which has been
most often and most seriously misapplied in sociology and politics--the
struggle for existence. Never was the proverb about the Devil’s quoting
Scripture better exemplified than in this matter. This fundamental
idea of Darwin’s has been used as justification for three totally
different and indeed incompatible political doctrines. In England, it
has served chiefly to bolster up _laissez-faire_ individualism and
free competition. In Germany in the years immediately succeeding the
publication of the _Origin of Species_, it was seized upon by the
Socialists as implying equal opportunity for all as against feudalism
or hereditary aristocracy. Later in the same country (and to a certain
extent elsewhere) it was abundantly employed as a theoretical support
for militarism.

As a matter of fact, the use of it as sole principle governing the
interrelation of biological units is wholly unjustified. As has been
shown by a number of writers, among whom may especially be mentioned
Darwin himself, Ritchie in his _Darwinism and Politics_, and Kropotkin
in his _Mutual Aid_, the struggle for existence is only _one_ of two
possibilities in this relationship: the other is that of co-operation,
of mutual aid, which is especially well marked in the building up of
higher-grade units from a multiplicity of smaller lower-grade ones. Two
of the most important steps in the whole evolutionary process have been
based on the co-operation of units--the origin of multicellular from
unicellular organisms, and the development of true man, with his social
life, from his pre-human ancestor. It is also prominent in the lives
of many species of the highest groups--insects, mammals, and birds:
witness the ants and bees, the rook, the wild dog, the elephant, the
baboon. In fact, once the bodily specialization of units has reached
a certain pitch, progress, as we have seen, is only possible through
mental development, and this in the great majority of cases brings
about aggregation into some sort of community, held together by mental
bonds.

Besides aggregation of similar units, there has frequently been
co-operation between units of unlike character and origin--witness
symbiosis, as in lichens; the relation between many insects and
flowers; the formation of flocks consisting of two or more species, as
with jackdaws and rooks, and many other cases.

Competition and co-operation both occur throughout the whole of
evolution: but co-operation comes to play an ever more considerable
part in higher forms. In lower organisms enormous overproduction is
of no great consequence; their organization is simple, and, given
favourable conditions, they can turn inorganic matter into their own
specific substance at a great rate. But higher forms are more complex,
more delicately balanced, and longer lived. Accordingly, waste of life
is of greater consequence to them, and methods by which a struggle on
the grand scale can be minimized tend to be more and more adopted. We
find regularly, for instance, a reduction of the number of offspring in
higher groups together with greater parental care.

Thus co-operation, for still fresh reasons, is biologically important
for the higher groups. The problem is becoming increasingly pressing
for the human race, since the time is in sight when the whole habitable
area of the globe will be colonized, up to a certain level of density
and efficiency, by members of the more advanced races. Biologically
speaking, it is perfectly clear that some co-operative system,
involving federation in one form or another, is the proper system to
adopt; and that the “world-state”--not necessarily organized after
the plan of our present highly specialized nationalist-industrialist
states, which appear happily to represent only a temporary phase
of evolution, but none the less an organic reality, a co-operative
unit--that the “world-state” is not merely a figment of unpractical
dreamers, but an obviously desirable aim for humanity. Kant, a century
and a half ago even, had seen clearly enough that some universal
society was a necessity for the unfolding of human possibility; and had
gone further and pointed out that there were indications of a movement
of civilization in that direction. In our time, this movement has been
retarded by the extraordinary and mushroom growth of Nationalism, in
which to the average man his “Country” (really _Nation_) has become
his most real God. In the last hundred years, Nationalism has usurped
the place of Religion as the most important super-individual interest
of individuals--has indeed in some sense become a religion. It is
leading the world into an impasse, as do all incomplete and partial
conceptions; but, in the Hague Court and the League of Nations, has
already generated the seeds of what will in time devour it.[23]

To sum up, we may say that the crude application to human affairs of
the doctrine of the struggle for existence, torn from its biological
context, isolated and over-emphasized, is wholly unwarranted. On the
other hand, a struggle does continue, both of the direct and indirect
type defined by Darwin: and there is no prospect of it ceasing to play
an important part in human biology. Co-operation is not, any more than
competition, to be taken as the sole desirable principle. Panaceas of
this sort do not exist, except to make bubble reputations and quack
fortunes. Even within such a highly organized co-operative unit as
the mammalian body a struggle continues--the different tissues are
in competition with each other for food, and if the available supply
diminishes below the necessary level, some tissues will be drawn upon
by other more successful competitors, and the struggle will lead to an
end-result in which the proportion of the various kinds of cells comes
to be very different from what they were in the normal well-nourished
body.[24] That is a purely biological example. In man, since the
unification of the community is of a low order, it is inevitable that
individuals and sections will continue in some form of competition with
each other: not only this, however, but the additional fact that man’s
mental organization reacts strongly to the stimulus of competition make
it probable that a “struggle” of some sort will not only be inevitable
but up to a point beneficial in any form of society. What is more, once
co-operation exists, competition between the co-operative units is
necessary to bring out the full efficiency of their combination.

All that the biologist can do is to point out that neither the
one-sided application of the principle of struggle nor of that of
co-operation is biologically sound. But, as everywhere else in human
conduct, after the broad principles have been grasped, success lies
always in a delicate, continuous adjustment of conflicting claims, in
what one may call a personal conscious effort. Struggle is universal:
but by itself it can only lead to a certain stage of evolutionary
progress.

The half-baked moralist may lay down the law about right and wrong
with the most positive assurance; but, by not paying attention to the
necessity for sweet reasonableness, give-and-take, unselfishness, for
thought about the thousand and one details of daily conduct, he may be
making himself and his wife thoroughly unhappy, ruining his family’s
chances, and, as a matter of fact, be thoroughly immoral without once
suspecting it.

It is in a very similar way that the militarist, for instance,
fortifying himself in the doctrine of the struggle for existence with
what he regards as an impregnable sanction for his theories, is in
reality acting immorally because not attempting to envisage the whole
problem.

There is one very interesting evolutionary point which well illustrates
the difference between pure biology and pure sociology, and yet
emphasizes the natural connection between the two. Once again it has
a connection with the greater flexibility of human mind. As we have
seen, in the lowest animals behaviour is for the most part unvarying,
hereditarily determined: the organism is capable of a number of
definite reactions, and if these do not suffice to extricate it from
difficulties, it perishes. The first step towards gaining is the
power of learning. “Once bitten, twice shy” is applicable to all
higher vertebrates; and it is not only the burnt child who dreads the
fire (although a study of moths and candles will convince us that
“Lepidopteran” cannot be substituted as subject of the proverb).

When, as in the higher mammals, the power of learning by experience is
rapid, the individual organism is better able to adjust itself to the
dangers of life, and once more there is less sacrifice of individuals
in the struggle. The same organism persists: but of two possible types
of behaviour, the unmodified innate type is eliminated, the type
modified by experience survives. If we like to put it in a way which
is perhaps not wholly justifiable, there comes into being, besides the
struggle for existence between individuals, a struggle for existence
between different possible modes of reaction of one and the same
organism.

With the advent of man upon the scene, still new possibilities arise.
First of all, he is capable of ideas, which, biologically speaking, are
to be regarded as potentialities of behaviour. There is no evidence at
present that even the highest animals possess ideas or even images.[25]
Secondly, these ideas are transmissible by speech and writing, and
accordingly tradition has come into being, so that modification of
behaviour by experience can be operative not only within the individual
life, not only from one generation to the next immediately succeeding,
as in many mammals, but for an indefinite period. The experience of
Moses, Archimedes, or Charlemagne, of Jesus, Newton, or James Watt is
modifying our behaviour to-day.

The result, both for individuals and communities, is that a selection
of ideas instead of a selection of organic units can to an ever greater
extent take place; and thus the actual extinction of living matter
be increasingly avoided. For instance, we find the substitution of
judicial procedure, in which the ideas of two disputants about the
matter in dispute are weighed and a selection made in favour of one,
for various forms of violence and combat in which one or other of the
actual disputants was often eliminated. Or again, in struggles between
communities, even though warfare is still resorted to, yet it does
not operate in the same way as in earlier stages of human evolution. A
salient example of this is afforded by the result of the recent war to
Germany; although an equally good instance can be seen, for example,
in the Boer War. In primitive wars, the defeated tribe was wherever
possible exterminated or enslaved: it ceased to exist as an independent
unit, and the great majority of its male members were killed. This is
impossible under present conditions: and all those who preserve, or
have ever possessed, any political sanity aim, for instance, neither at
the physical nor the economic destruction or subordination of Germany,
but--to use one of those attractive catchwords that sounded so well in
war-time--at her “change of heart”--in other words, the extermination,
not of a nation, but of a national tradition.

To what extent this substitution of mental for physical will continue
it is hard to say; already, to take another field, the multiplication
of cheap books has led to an ever increasing number of men and women
finding most of their adventure and romance in books instead of in the
life that we are accustomed to call real. But that would lead us away
from our main point--enough to have indicated another great difference
between processes above and below the human level.

There are numerous important questions concerning our right to apply
biological ideas of heredity directly to human beings which I would
have liked to touch upon. But for one thing I have not the time, and
for another, Mr. Carr-Saunders in his recent book on the Population
Problem has dealt so fully with the relation between biological
inheritance and what may be called tradition-inheritance, that I omit
them with a good conscience.

In this brief treatment I have had to ask you to take conclusions on
trust, without presenting the evidence on which they are based; this,
however, is inevitable when transferring ideas from one science to
another. I have attempted to show, first, that biology can profit by
incorporating certain conclusions of sociology and so rounding off and
completing certain of its own principles: on the other hand, I have put
before you my belief that there are certain basic biological principles
which must be taken into account by the sociologist--principles which
hold good in sociology because man too is an organism.

By now, however, we can see more clearly the way in which the various
sciences with which we are concerned, of whose relations we had
something to say at the beginning of this essay, properly interlock.

They interlock thus. The physico-chemical sciences are basic to
biology. Organisms are made of the same substances as are non-living
compounds; their processes are therefore conformable to certain
physico-chemical laws, such as the indestructibility of matter, the
conservation of energy, and so forth; and in so far as we analyse the
material aspect of life, physico-chemical concepts are _adequate_.
On the other hand, physico-chemical concepts--or at least our
present ones--are not _all-sufficient_. In the first place, the very
complicated arrangement of matter which is found in living substance
has not been yet sufficiently analysed by physics and chemistry:
accordingly we find many processes occurring in biology--such as the
directional changes in evolution of which we have spoken--which could
not have been foretold on our present physico-chemical knowledge,
but must be investigated separately as adding to our store of facts
and principles, in the confident hope that a synthesis will one
day be possible. Secondly, a whole new category of phenomena, the
psychological, is first met with in biology, and to this we cannot as
yet apply physical or chemical ideas at all.

For a combination of these two reasons, biology deals with certain
concepts which are not implicit in current physico-chemical ideas.
Physics and chemistry are basic for biology, but they are not
exhaustive.

In a very similar way, biology is basic for sociology, but again not
exhaustive. Certain limits are set to human life through man’s organic
nature. Certain of his activities can be completely analysed in terms
of biology. But other of his activities, especially those concerned
with his new type of mental organization, find no counterpart in
the rest of the biological kingdoms, and must be studied in and for
themselves.

Bergson would have us believe that evolution is creative. It is better
to say, with Lloyd Morgan, that it is emergent. With new degrees of
complexity, new qualitative differences emerge. Thus the sciences are
a hierarchy, the subject-matter of one constituting the foundation for
the next in the series. All that biology can do for sociology is to
help her to build her foundations solidly and correctly: but we all
know that without good foundations no building is safe.
