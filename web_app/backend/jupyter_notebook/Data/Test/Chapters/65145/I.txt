           EVOLUTION: AT THE MIND’S CINEMA

     I turn the handle and the story starts:
       Reel after reel is all astronomy,
       Till life, enkindled in a niche of sky,
     Leaps on the stage to play a million parts.

     Life leaves the slime and through all ocean darts;
       She conquers earth, and raises wings to fly;
       Then spirit blooms, and learns how not to die,--
     Nesting beyond the grave in others’ hearts.

     --I turn the handle: other men like me
     Have made the film: and now I sit and look
     In quiet, privileged like Divinity
     To read the roaring world as in a book.
       If this thy past, where shall thy future climb,
     O Spirit, built of Elements and Time!

     MUNICH, _Jan. 1923_.




PROGRESS, BIOLOGICAL AND OTHER


     “Usus et impigrae simul experientia mentis
     Paulatim docuit pedetemtim progredientes.”
                                 --LUCRETIUS.


     “As natural selection works solely by and for the good of each
     being, all corporeal and mental environments will tend to progress
     towards perfection.”
                                                     --CHARLES DARWIN.


     “Social progress means the checking of the cosmic process at every
     step and the substitution for it of another which may be called
     the ethical process.”
                                                    --T. H. HUXLEY.


     “It is probable that what hindered Kant from broaching his
     theory of progress with as much confidence as Condorcet was his
     perception that nothing could be decisively affirmed about the
     course of civilization until the laws of its movement had been
     discovered. He saw that this was a matter for future scientific
     investigation.”
                                                     --J. B. BURY.


What is the most fundamental need of man? It would be interesting to
conduct a plebiscite of such a question, a plebiscite of the same sort
that was conducted by one of the French newspapers some years ago,
to discover the opinions of its readers as to who was the greatest
Frenchman of the century.

When I say the most fundamental need of man, I do not mean those basic
needs for food and drink and shelter which he shares with the animals:
I mean the most fundamental to him _as man_, as an organism differing
from all other organisms in the power of thought, in reflection and
self-consciousness. What variety of answers would be given, I dare not
guess; but I hazard the belief that the majority, if the suggestion
were put before them, would agree that his deepest need was to discover
something, some being or power, some force or tendency, which was
moulding the destinies of the world--something not himself, greater
than himself, with which he yet felt that he could harmonize his
nature, in which he could repose his doubts, through faith in which he
could achieve confidence and hope.

That need has been felt by all those to whom life has been more
than a problem of the unreflective satisfaction of instincts and
desires--however pure those instincts, or beautiful those desires;
it has been felt by all in whom the problem of existence has been
apprehended by intellect and disinterested imagination.

I say all. There may be rare creatures who, secure in strength of body
and mind and in unhampered unfolding of their faculties, possess a
confidence by which this need is never felt. They are like those whom
Wordsworth drew for us in the “Ode to Duty”:--


     “There are who ask not if thine eye
     Be on them; who, in love and truth,
     Where no misgiving is, rely
     Upon the genial sense of youth:
     Glad hearts! without reproach or blot;
     Who do thy work and know it not.”


But such are rare; or should we say that their type of mind, though
not uncommon in the earlier years of life, only by the rarest chance
achieves its course without a descent into that vale where the finite
human intellect grapples unequally with infinite problems?

The need has been felt in all ages and in all countries; and the
answers, the partial satisfactions of the needs which have been found
by the mind of men, are correspondingly diverse.

Savages have endowed the objects around them, living and inanimate,
with supernatural qualities. At a higher grade of development they
have created gods made with hands, visible images of their fears or
their desires, by whose worship and service they assuaged the urgent
need within their breast. Still later, turning from such crudity, they
became servants and worshippers of unseen gods, conceived under the
form of persons, but persons transcending human personality, beings in
whom was vested the control of man and of the world.

Up to this point there had been an increase of spirituality in the
constructions by which human thought satisfied its need; none the less,
the ideas underlying the mode of these constructions had not materially
altered. As Voltaire so pungently put it, man had created God in his
own image.

What remains? there remains to search in the external world, to find
there if possible a foundation of fact for the belief drawn from the
inner world of mind, to test the conceptions of a supreme being or
supereminent power against ever more and more touchstones of reality,
until the most sceptical shall acknowledge that the final construction
represents, with whatever degree of incompleteness, yet not a mere
fragment educed to fill a void, however inevitable, to satisfy a
longing, however natural, but the summary and essence of a body of
verifiable fact, having an existence independent of the wishes or
ideals of mankind.

It was the striving after some such certainty that led Matthew Arnold
to his famous definition of God as “something, not ourselves, which
makes for righteousness.” Dissatisfaction with the assertion that
belief in a very special and undemonstrable form of Divinity was
necessary as an act of faith has, in a large measure, helped the
widespread revulsion against orthodox Christianity. It was the need for
some external, ascertainable basis for belief which led such different
minds as William James and H. G. Wells to approach religion, and in
such diverse ways as in the “Varieties of Religious Experience” and in
“God the Invisible King.” It is this same need which is leading the
representatives of Christianity to lay ever greater stress upon the
reality and pragmatic value of the religious experience, less and less
upon dogmas and creeds.

It will be my attempt in this brief paper to show how the facts of
evolutionary biology provide us, in the shape of a verifiable doctrine
of progress, with one of the elements most essential to any such
externally-grounded conception of God, to any construction which shall
be able to serve as permanent satisfaction of that deepest need whereof
we have spoken.

Any such construction must take account of many separate parts of
reality. In the first place, it must consider those realities inherent
in the mind of man: his desire for goodness; the sense of value which
all agree is attached to certain experiences of mystics and to certain
religious emotions; his ideals and their importance for the conduct of
life. But in the second place it must consider those realities which
are independent of man and of his mind--the ascertainable body of hard
fact, those things which existed before ever he existed, which would
exist were he to disappear, with which he must struggle as best he may.
Lastly, there is the need for intermediation between the one and the
other reality, between the inner _felt_ and the outer _known_.

Mr. Wells,[1] if you remember, erected a new trinitarianism, which in
broad outlines corresponded with this division. With his particular
construction, I do not in many respects agree. But that some form
of trinitarianism is a reasonably natural method of symbolizing the
inevitable tripleness of inner experience, outer fact, and their
interrelation is obvious enough. In the particular trinitarianism
of Christianity, the reality apprehended to exist behind the forces
of Nature is called the Father, the upspringing force within the
mind of man, especially when it seems to transcend individuality and
to overflow into what we designate as the mystical, is called the
Holy Ghost, and the activity, personal or vicarious, which mediates
between the individual and the rest of the universe, reconciling
his incompleteness and his failures with its apparent sternness and
inexorableness, is called the Son.

Some men lay more weight on one of these aspects than on the others.
I know a clergyman of the Church of England who, on being reproached
during a theological argument with failure to pay sufficient respect
to the doctrine of God the Father, replied: “I am not interested in
God the Father”; and I know intellectually-minded men who wish to
reject the validity of all religious experience because their minds
are so made that they pay more attention to external fact and because
their reason refuses to let them agree with the interpretations of
fact propounded by most religious bodies. But, for a properly balanced
construction, for the finding of something which shall serve not as the
basis of a creed for this or that sect, but of a creed for humanity, of
something which instead of dividing shall unite, we need all aspects.

The idea of Progress constitutes, as I hope to show, the most important
element in the first part of our construction--that which attempts to
synthesize the facts of Nature; and besides, no inconsiderable portion
of the third, the interrelation of inner and outer.

Readers of Bury’s interesting book on the Idea of Progress[2] will
perhaps, with me, have been surprised at the modernity of that
conception. He shows how, in antiquity, the idea was never a dominant
one, and further that the adumbrations made of it all lacked some
element without which it cannot be styled progress in the sense in
which that word is used to-day.

Not indeed till the late Renaissance can we say that the idea of
Progress became in any real sense incorporated with the common thought
of Western civilization. From then to the present it has suffered
many vicissitudes. Starting in the XVIIth century as little more than
a consciousness of the superiority of the present over the past, in
the XVIIIth it changed to a dogma, its adherents claiming that there
existed a “Law of Progress” leading inevitably to the perfectioning
of humanity. In the XIXth century the dogma was questioned, and
thinkers began to put it to the test--the test of comparing theory with
historical fact. A new lease of life, however, was given to the idea of
a law of progress by the evolution theory; but finally, of late years,
there has been a marked reaction, leading not only to a denial of any
such inevitable law, but often to a questioning of the very existence
of Progress in any shape or form.

It is the business of the philosopher and of the biologist to see
whether this scepticism be justified, and to find out by a more
scientific approach how much of the doctrine of Progress is valid.
To the layman it would seem inevitable, once the validity of the
evolution theory was granted, to concede the fact of Progress in some
form or another. If we accept the doctrine of evolution, we are bound
to believe that man has arisen from mammals, terrestrial from aquatic
forms, vertebrates from invertebrates, multicellular from unicellular,
and in general the larger and the more complex from the smaller and
simpler. To the average man it will appear indisputable that a man is
_higher_ than a worm or a polyp, an insect _higher_ than a protozoan,
even if he cannot exactly define in what resides this highness or
lowness of organic types.

It is, curiously enough, among the professional biologists that
objectors to the notion of biological progress and to its corollary,
the distinction of higher and lower forms of life, have chiefly been
found. I say curiously enough, and yet to a dispassionate observer it
is perhaps not so curious, but only one further instance of that common
human failing, the inability to see woods because of the trees that
compose them.

That is as it may be. Our best course will be to start by examining
some of the chief objections to the idea of biological progress, in
order to see if they involve errors of thought which we may then avoid.

The most widespread of all the objections raised may, I think, be
fairly put as follows: “The fundamental attribute of living beings
is adaptation to environment. A man is not better adapted to his
environment than the flea which lives upon him as a parasite, or than
the bacillus which kills him, nor is a bird better adapted to air than
a jelly-fish to water; therefore we have no right to speak of one as
higher than the other, or to regard the transition from one type to
another as involving progress.”

A second class of objector is prepared to admit that there has been
an increase of complexity, an increase in the degree of organization
during evolution, but refuses to allow that increase of complexity
has any value in itself, whether biological or philosophical, and
accordingly refuses to dignify this trend towards greater complexity by
the name of progress.

Yet a third difficulty is raised by those who ask us to fix our
attention on forms of life like Lingula, the lamp-shell, which, though
millions of years elapse, do not evolve. If there exists a Law of
Progress, they say, how is it that such creatures are exempt from its
operations?

Finally, a somewhat similar attitude is adopted by those who refuse
to grant that evolution can involve progress when it has, as we know,
brought about well-nigh innumerable degenerations. Granted, for
instance, they would say, that the average Crustacean is in many ways
an improvement upon the simple form of life from which we must suppose
that it arose, yet we know that within the group of Crustacea there are
several lines of descent which have led to the production of parasitic
forms--animals in which the activity and complex organization of the
ancestral type has been sacrificed, and as end-product we are presented
with a hateful being, an almost shapeless mass consisting of little
else but over-developed reproductive organs and mechanisms for sucking
nutriment from its unfortunate host. Such a result is revealed to us
in the Crustacean form Sacculina, and is paralleled by countless other
examples in almost every class of animals. The degradation of parasites
and sedentary types is equally a product of the evolutionary process
with the genesis of the ant, the bird or the human being; how then can
we call the evolutionary process progressive?

These are important objections. Can they be met? In the broadest way
they can and must be met by the only possible method, the method of
Science, which consists in examining facts objectively, and by drawing
conclusions not a priori, but a posteriori. A law of Nature is not (and
I wonder how often this fallacy has been exploded, only to reappear
next day)--a law of Nature is not something revealed, not something
absolute, not something imposed on phenomena from without or from
above; it is no more and no less than a summing-up, in generalized
form, of our own observations of phenomena; it is an epitome of fact
from which we can draw several conclusions. By beginning in this way
from the very beginning, by examining the basis of our mode of thinking
in natural science, only thus are we enabled to see at one and the same
moment how to investigate the question of progress on the constructive
side, and how to neutralize the force of the objections to the idea.

Questions of fact are simple to deal with. It is indubitable that some
forms of life remain stationary and unevolving for secular periods; it
is equally indubitable that degeneration is widespread in evolution.
These are facts. But we are not therefore called upon to deny the
possibility of progress. To do so would be to fall into the error
of reasoning which we have already condemned. It remains for us to
take these facts into account when examining the totality of facts
concerning organic life, and to see whether, in spite of them, we
cannot discover a series of other facts, a movement in phenomena, which
may still legitimately be called progress. To deny progress because of
degeneration is really no more legitimate than to assert that, because
each wave runs back after it has broken, therefore the tide can never
rise.

Similarly with the first two objections. If the degree of adaptation
has not increased during evolution, then it is clear that progress
does not consist in increase in adaptation. But it does not follow
that progress does not exist; it may quite well consist in an increase
of other qualities. So with complexity. Complexity has increased, but
increase in complexity is not progress, say the objectors. Granted:
but may there not be something else which has increased besides mere
complexity?

No; the remedy for all our difficulties, and indeed the only way in
which we can arrive at the _possibility_ of saying whether biological
progress exists or no, is to adopt the positive method.

Let us then begin our survey of biological evolution in the endeavour
to find whether or no progress is visible there. To start with, we must
be clear what are the sources of our knowledge on the subject.

Direct observation of progressive evolution has, of course, not yet
been possible in the period--biologically negligible--in which man has
directed his attention to the problem; and historical record is also
absent. The best available evidence is that of paleontology: here the
relative positions of the layers of the earth’s crust enable us to
deduce their temporal sequence--and naturally, that of the organisms
whose fossil remains they embalm--with a great deal of accuracy.[3]

We can scarcely ever observe the direct transition from the forms of
life in an older to those in a younger stratum, nor can we absolutely
prove their genetic relationship. But in a vast number of cases it is
abundantly clear that the later type of organization is descended from
the former--that a group of forms in the younger stratum had its origin
in one or more species of the group to which the forms in the older
stratum belong. Sometimes, however, as in many groups of mammals, the
gaps are few and small, the seriation almost complete. In any event we
have here evidence which, so far as it goes, is perfectly admissible
for the main lines and for many of the smaller branches of evolutionary
descent.

Unfortunately, it does not go very far--or, we had better say, it is
of restricted application. By the time we find well-preserved fossils
in the rocks, the main groups of the animal kingdom and their chief
subdivisions had been already differentiated, with the one important
exception of the vertebrates; while time, heat, and pressure have
so modified the earlier strata as to destroy the fossil forefathers
of insects, molluscs, crustacea, and the rest, which they must have
contained.

Within the vertebrate stock, then, we can learn a great deal from
the semi-direct methods of paleontology: but for the history of the
other groups and for their origin and interrelations, we are driven
back upon comparative anatomy and embryology, into another field of
more circumstantial evidence. When, for instance, we find that the
fore-limbs of bat, bird, whale, horse, and man, although so different
in function and in detail of structure, are yet built upon the same
general plan, and upon a plan wholly different from that of the
limbs, say, of a spider or an insect, we must either deny reason and
say that this similarity means nothing; or assume that its cause
is supernatural, outside the province of science, that it is the
expression of some eternal Idea, or some plan of a personal creator
(in which case, be it noted, the idea or the plan often appears to
our intellect as unreasonable and indeed stupid); or finally that it
implies community of origin with later divergence of development. When
we are dealing with the smaller sub-divisions of some larger group,
this method too gives us information of the same order of accuracy as
does paleontology: but when we try to understand the relationships
of these larger groups, then we are forced to renounce any claim to
detailed knowledge. In broad outline, however, a great deal still
remains, and this broad outline we can employ for our valuation of the
whole sweep of biological progress, just as we can use the greater
accuracy of vertebrate paleontology and comparative morphology to fill
in the detail within a restricted field of its operation. From these
various evidences, direct and indirect, we can paint for ourselves a
picture of the evolution of life which, in spite of inevitable gaps and
errors, is in its main features adequate and true.

Let us not be misled by the fact that disputes can and justifiably do
arise over details: as Professor Bateson put it recently[4]:--

“If the broad lines do not hold, then we must sink into irrationality
or turn to flagrant supernaturalism.”

Let us then remind ourselves of some of these broad lines.

We know that there was a time when the earth, hot and fiery, could
not have been the abode of life. Of the first origins of life we know
nothing and guess little. What we can justifiably surmise is that
the protoplasm of the original organisms was not yet differentiated
into cytoplasm and nucleus, and that sexuality had not yet arisen.
The bacteria, however specialized in other ways, are still in this
primitive condition.

Later, we can with great probability infer that the independent
units into which the stuff of life was subdivided reached a size
which, though still minute, was at least not beyond or even close to
the limits of microscopic vision; they were further provided with a
nucleus, and occasionally underwent sexual fusion. In other words, they
showed an organization which we call cellular; they were free-living
cells. Such unicellular creatures must have been at one epoch sole
inhabitants of the earth, and diverged into the most manifold types of
structure and modes of life. Such of them as led an animal as opposed
to a plant type of existence would be classified under the Protozoa or
unicellular animals.[5]

The colonial habit gives advantages of increased size and greater
rapidity of motion, of which many Protozoa have availed themselves. A
colonial existence once attained, division of labour, at first between
the germinal and the somatic, later between different types of somatic
units, will be a further advantage. Such organisms, of which we cannot
say definitely whether they are compound aggregates or single wholes,
would represent the most natural link between the unicellular Protozoan
and the rest of the animal kingdom, the multicellular forms or Metazoa.
And indeed such organisms exist at the present day--organisms such as
Volvox, Zoothamnium, Proterospongia, and Myxidium--as adjuvant and
confirmatory of our reasonable faith.

The multicellular organisms appear to have originated twice over, by
divergent routes. There are the true Metazoa, to which belong all the
higher types, and the Parazoa or sponges, which have never passed
beyond a very primitive type of structure. Both start as simple sacs,
whose walls are formed from two primary sheets or layers of cells.
Leaving sponges out of account, the Hydroid polyps are the simplest
representative of this grade of structure, while some of the Jelly-fish
and Siphonophores have attained the utmost limit of its inherent
possibilities.

The next great step was the intercalation of a third primary layer
between the other two. The result of this, the so-called triploblastic
type of organization, gives the ground-plan for all subsequent
organizations; and later evolution consists mainly in the evolution of
this ground-plan.

In other words, we can now pass from the consideration of the general
plan of life’s architecture to that of its details. During the next
great tract of time, that which was novel in life (for we must not
be guilty of a _petitio principii_ in yet speaking of “advance” or
“progress”) was brought about in two main ways--by an increase in
the size of organisms, and by an increase in the efficiency of their
working.

The simplest Metazoa, such as the polyps, as well as the simplest
three-layered forms, such as the free-living flat-worms, are all small,
composed of an amount of material comparable with that contained in a
single one of our hairs. In every group of Metazoa, increase of size is
one of the main features that accompanies specialization, and the more
specialized groups possess a higher average size than the less.

A jelly-fish against a polyp; a cuttle-fish against a primitive
mollusc; a vertebrate against its chordate ancestor; the giant reptiles
of the late secondary period against their forbears; a horse against
Phenacodus; man against the earliest primates--over and over again does
size increase with the march of time.

Not only this, but when there occurs aggregation of individuals to
form units of a higher order, as in bees and ants and termites, and in
man himself, there too increase of size in the new units thus produced
is one of the most notable features. Is not human history in large
measure the history of the increase in size of social units?

But size alone is not enough; there is also a definite improvement of
the details of life’s mechanism--partly revealed as improvement in the
efficiency of the parts themselves, partly in the adjustment of the
parts to each other, and their subordination to the needs of the whole.

It is scarcely necessary to detail the improvements in efficiency of
different organs during evolution: such are universally familiar. But
a few examples will point my moral. The lowest three-layered forms
have no circulatory system; this, rendered necessary later by increase
of size, shows a gradual differentiation of parts in evolution. The
exquisite machinery of our heart is directly descended from a minute
pulsating ventral vessel such as that seen in Amphioxus. Protection and
support are better cared for in insect than in worm, in mammal than in
lamprey. But the most spectacular improvement of function, the most
important of all the directional movements in evolution has been that
affecting the nervous system and the sense-organs associated with it.
Few people who have not gone carefully into the subject realize how
imprisoned and windowless are the existences led by lower forms of life.

Even such physically well-organized creatures as Crustacea stand at
an amazingly low mental level. The other day I was reading a careful
account of experiments on the behaviour of crabs. The method by which
the sexes recognize each other is so crude that I am not sure whether
it deserves the term recognition at all. Before mating, which takes
place immediately after a moult, the female is carried about for some
time in the claws of the male. The mature males will attempt to lift
up and carry off any members of the same species, male or female: but
the only ones which will permit themselves to be thus carried about are
females just before moulting. Hence by a general instinct to lift any
members of the same species on the part of the males, and on the part
of the females an instinct to allow themselves to be lifted when in
the physiological condition which precedes moulting, the required end
is brought about. But of any mental operation such as is involved in
sex-recognition in man or any other mammal, there is no evidence.

Fish, to take another example, possess associative memory; they can
learn. But they learn very slowly, and learn only the simplest things.
The jump from their powers of memory to those of a dog, who can be
trained comparatively quickly to carry out complicated tricks, is as
great as the further jump from the powers of a dog to those of a man
capable of learning a page of print by heart in two or three readings.

The first organs connected with mind to become elaborated are the
organs of sense: but such _receptor_ organs are useless to their
possessor, however elaborate, unless put into relation with proper
_effector_ organs--organs for action, whether locomotor or secretory.
So that the first steps are the elaboration of sense-organs, the
increase of efficiency of muscles and glands, and, equally essential,
the construction of an improved “_adjustor system_,” whereby the
stimulus falling on the sense-organ may be translated into action and
into the right kind of action. This adjustor mechanism is the central
nervous system. Most of the further history of organisms may be summed
up in one phrase--the evolution of adjustor mechanisms.

At first, it is chiefly of importance to be brought into relation with
more and more of the happenings of the outer world, to be able to see
and hear and feel and smell more and more delicately; and to react upon
the outer world more and more efficiently and powerfully, to be able
to move and to handle matter more quickly and with finer and finer
adjustment.

But unless the adjustor mechanism be improved, this process soon tends
to a limit. I may illustrate my meaning by a simple supposition.
Suppose an organism capable of very little beyond reflexes and
instincts and with but a scanty dose of associative power: of what
conceivable use to it would be a telescope or a telephone? Man obtains
a biological advantage from such accessory sense-organs in that, when
thus apprised of events at a distance, he is enabled to plan out
courses of action to meet the events which he imagines are going to
overtake him: but both planning and imagination are entirely functions
of an adjustor mechanism, and without such a mechanism, great
enlargement of sensory power would only result in an organism reacting
too often and unnecessarily to events in its environment.

There is, in fact, an obvious limit to the perfection which can be
attained by receptor and effector organs. Striated muscles, the
modelling of the skeleton and joints for speed in a horse or greyhound,
the eye and ear of higher vertebrates, the mammalian sense of smell--no
doubt it would be possible for life to have produced more perfect and
more efficient mechanisms--but not, apparently, mechanisms _much_
more perfect or _much_ more efficient. They stand near the limit of
biological efficiency.

There thus comes a time when it is impossible or extremely difficult
to give an organism advantage in the struggle by improving its
sense-organs or its locomotor system, or indeed any of its general
physical construction, whereas it is still possible to confer the most
important advantages upon it by means of improvements in the adjustor
mechanism, improvements which involve and imply improvements of mind.

This stage was reached by mammals and birds quite early in the Tertiary
period; and one of the most striking spectacles of biology, revealed
in the fossils of successive strata, is to see Mind coming into its
own after this epoch. Over and over again a group of animals is seen
to appear and spread, only to be extinguished and replaced by another
type which to all outward appearance is similar, no better adapted
to the conditions of life. But the two types differ in one point: the
later possessed a larger brain, and so, from all analogy, a better
mind. Or, to take another example, man differs from the lower animals
in no notable _physical_ specialization except the upright posture.

After this critical point in the evolution of organisms was reached,
further development has consisted chiefly in the development of mind:
and this has meant, from the objective, purely biological standpoint,
the possibility of summing-up ever more and more power and fine
adjustment of response in the present, in the single act.[6]

The first main function of the improved adjustor mechanism was to make
ever more complicated actions possible; but this again tended speedily
to a limit. The next step was to make it possible for the past to
act in the present. Through associative memory, present behaviour is
modified by past experience. What this has meant to organisms can be
realized if we reflect that certain terms which can justly be applied
to a mammal or a bird have no real meaning if applied to lower forms.
If we speak of a cunning wolf or a wary crow, we imply that their life
has taught them new qualities; but it is nonsense to talk of a cunning
crab, and, though we might properly ascribe wariness to a trout, I
would not like to speak of a wary Amoeba. In the same way we can
justifiably say that one dog is affectionate, another intelligent:
but to speak of an affectionate earthworm or an intelligent snail has
no more proper significance than it would be to say that a dog was
intellectual or religious.

Quickness of learning then became of importance; but so long as the
faculty of generalizing is absent, associative memory, although
liberating organisms from the prison of a fixed and inherited
mental constitution, still pins them down to the accidental and the
particular; an organism can only learn to react to those particular
experiences which chance has decreed that it should have had.

The next and last salient step in evolution was a double one. Which
of its two parts came first is hard to say; probably they acted
reciprocally throughout. This step was, on the one hand, the attainment
of the power of generalization--of reason, concept-formation, or what
you will--and on the other the origin of tradition, which in its turn
was made possible by the acquisition of speech and of a gregarious mode
of life. By these means, the human species and its evolving ancestors
were gradually enabled, first, to free experience ever more and more
from the accidental and to store what was essential; and, secondly, to
bring gradually more and more of the experience of the whole race to
bear upon the present problem, and to plan further and further ahead,
and on a larger and larger scale.

This has meant, among other things, that for the first time in
biological history there has been an aggregation (in the technical
biological sense) of minds. Over and over again in evolution does
the process of aggregation appear.[7] It is an advantage, for at one
jump it lands life on a new level of size, with new possibilities of
division of labour and specialization. It appears in the aggregation
of Protozoa to form the colonial ancestor of all higher, many-celled
forms. It appears again on this new level in the aggregation of hydroid
polyps, of polyzoa, of ascidians, and especially in the beautiful
floating Siphonophora, in which the polyp-like units (themselves
historically aggregates of cells) have become so subordinate in
relation to the whole that they can often scarcely be recognized as
individuals, and the individuality of the aggregate is much more marked
than that of its components. It appears in a new way in the Termites
and in the social Hymenoptera--ants, bees, and wasps. Here the bonds
uniting the members of the aggregate are not physical but mental,
their sense-impressions and instincts; but the principle is identical
throughout. Finally in man we have not merely aggregation of physical
individuals held together by mental bonds, but aggregation of minds as
well as of physical individuals.

In many mammals and birds, each generation can extend its influence
on to the next, and the experience of the parents is in part made
available to the offspring. But never until the origin of speech was
it possible for a whole series of generations to be linked together
by experience, never could experience be cumulative, never could one
mind know what another mind, remote in time, had been thinking or
feeling. Biologically, evolution since the time of origin of this new
process has consisted essentially in the enlargement and specialization
of aggregations of minds, and the improvement of the tradition which
constitutes the mode of inheritance for these aggregations--that
tradition which, like Hugo’s “Nef magique et suprême” of human destiny,
will eventually have “fait entrer dans l’homme tant d’azur qu’elle a
supprimé les patries.”

It will, I hope, have been clear, even from the few examples which
I have given, that there has been a main direction in evolution. At
the close of the paper I shall try to point out that since motion in
this direction has led to the production of an increasing intensity
of qualities which we are unanimous in calling valuable, since in
other words the application of our scale of values tends in the same
direction as has the march of evolutionary history, that therefore
we are justified in calling this direction progressive, and indeed
logically compelled to give to motion in this direction a name which,
like progress, implies the idea of value.

I shall therefore, from now on, use the term _biological progress_ to
denote movement in the direction which we have sketched in outline,
and shall shortly proceed to define more accurately. In so doing, I
perhaps beg the question, to be proved I hope later, as to whether the
observed direction is progressive: but I no longer beg the question of
whether evolution is a directional process. However we may argue on
the facts, the facts remain: and the facts are that there has been an
increase in certain qualities of organisms, both physical and mental,
during geological time.

Meanwhile, let it be remembered, the simplest forms have survived side
by side with the more complex, the less specialized with the more
specialized. Even when we can trace a causal relation between the rise
of one group and the decay of another, as with the mammals and birds on
the one hand, and the reptiles on the other, even then numbers of the
defeated group continue to exist. Thus, in broad terms, evolution is
not a transformation, be it progressive or no, of the whole of living
matter, but of a part of it.

I will endeavour to sum up, in brief, what seem to me the salient
points of that process, a sketch of which, inevitably hasty and
inadequate, I have just tried to give.

During the time of life’s existence on this planet, there has been
an increase, both in the average and far more in the upper level, of
certain attributes of living things.

In the first place there has been an increase in their size, brought
about by two methods, first by the increase of size of the units of
life themselves (cells, metazoan individuals, communities), secondly
by their aggregation; and this has been accompanied by a (very roughly)
parallel increase in the duration of life.

Next, there has been an increase in their complexity; and this in its
turn depends upon the fact that a division of labour has been brought
about between the parts of organisms, each part becoming specialized
for greater efficiency in the performance of some particular function.
In the fewest words, the separate bits of machinery of which organisms
are composed have become more efficient.

In the third place, there has been an increase in the harmony of these
parts, and consequently in the unity of the whole. Delicate mechanisms
for co-ordination have been developed, and arrangements whereby one
portion becomes dominant over the rest, and so a material basis for
unification is given.

In the fourth place, there has been an increase of self-regulation.
The outer environment changes from month to month, from hour to hour.
The more complex products of evolution are in high degree exempt from
the consequences of these changes, through being the possessors of a
constant internal environment which, beyond the narrowest limits, it is
most difficult to alter.

Fifthly, there has been an increase in the possibility of bringing
past experience to bear on present problems. At the base is the power
of modifying normal reactions with repetition; then come some simple
degrees of memory; then associative memory, as in birds and mammals,
for whom most reactions are not given in the inherited constitution,
but must be learnt; then rational memory, in which the power of
generalization liberates life from blind dependence upon the local and
the accidental; and finally tradition, whereby the amount of experience
available to the developing race is not constituted merely by the
isolated and limited experiences of its members, but by their sum. More
and more of the past becomes directly operative in the present; further
and further into the future can the aim of the present extend.

Finally we can conclude with a high degree of certainty that the
psychical faculties--of knowing, feeling, and willing--have increased
in intensity, and also in their relative importance for the life of the
individual organism.

We have condensed our summary into these six general statements; if
we wish to reach a still more general form, the most general form
possible, we can redistil it thus: During the course of evolution in
time, there has been an increase in the control exerted by organisms
over their environment, and in their independence with regard to it;
there has been an increase in the harmony of the parts of organisms;
and there has been an increase in the psychical powers of organisms, an
increase of willing, of feeling, and of knowing.

This increase has not been universal; many organisms have remained
stationary or have even regressed; many have shown increase in
one particular but not in others. But the _upper level_ of these
properties of living matter has been continually raised, their average
has continually increased. It is to this increase, continuous during
evolutionary time, in the average and especially in the upper level of
these properties that, I venture to think, the term biological progress
can be properly applied.

Used thus it is no more an a priori or an undefined concept. It is a
name for a complicated set of actual phenomena, and if, with progress
thus defined, we were to speak of a law of progress in evolution, we
should be using the term law in a perfectly legitimate way, as denoting
a generalization based on observed facts, and not as pre-supposing any
vitalistic principle of perfectibility, any necessary and mysterious
tendency of organisms to advance independently of circumstances.

The gas laws state that the pressure of a gas kept at constant volume
increases in a particular way with increase of temperature. Now the
pressure of a confined gas depends on the rate at which its particles
bombard the walls in which they are contained, and the speed at which
they are travelling. In a gas whose temperature is raised, many
particles will, at any given moment, be travelling more slowly than the
average rate when it was cooler, many even which had been travelling
fast may now be travelling slowly. None the less, the average speed of
all the particles is greater; and this and nothing else is what with
perfect justification we sum up as our _law_.

In biological evolution, some organisms degenerate, some remain
stationary, but the average of certain properties, and more especially
their upper level, increases; and this tendency for certain properties
to become more marked, this and nothing else, is what we sum up and
generalize, again with perfect justification, as the law of biological
progress.

The mechanism of biological progress demands a word: for it is
noticeable that a mere fact, however well attested, makes a very
different kind of impression from a fact explained and brought into
relation with the rest of our knowledge. The impression is either less
powerful; or else, an explanation being sought for, an erroneous one is
found. It was Darwin’s great merit that, not content with the piling up
of evidence in favour of the reality of Evolution, he at the same time
advanced a theory which made it at least possible to understand how
Evolution could have come to pass as a natural process. The effect was
multiplicative on men’s minds, not merely additive, for facts are too
bulky to be lugged about conveniently except on wheels of theory.

The fact of biological progress has struck many observers. Some have
been content to believe that the single magic formula of “Natural
Selection” would explain it adequately and without further trouble,
forgetting that there must be at least some points of difference
between a natural selection producing a degenerate type and natural
selection leading to progress. Some biologists have lumped it,
together with all other evolutionary processes which seem to show
us a development along predetermined lines, under the head of
_orthogenesis_--the (hypothetical!) tendency of organisms to unfold
just one type of hidden potentiality. Bergson has been particularly
struck with it: refuses to allow that it can have anything to do with
Natural Selection or any determinist process, and ascribes it to his
_élan vital_.

Here, as so often elsewhere, Bergson reveals himself as a good poet but
a bad scientist. His intellectual vision of evolution as a fact, as
something happening, something whole, to be apprehended in a unitary
way--that is unsurpassed. He seems to see it as vividly as you or I
might see a hundred yards race, holding its different incidents and
movements all in his mind together to form one picture. But he then
goes on to give a symbolic description of what he sees--and then
thinks that his symbols will serve in place of analytic explanations.
There _is_ an “urge of life”; and it is, as a matter of fact, urging
life up the steps of progress. But to say that biological progress is
explained by the _élan vital_ is to say that the movement of a train
is “explained” by an _élan locomotif_ of the engine: it is to fall
into the error, so often condemned in scientists by philosophers, and
ridiculed in both by satirists, of hanging or at least disposing of a
difficulty by giving it a long name.

Let us think of the condition of life on earth at any given moment of
her evolution. Certain possibilities have been realized by her--others
have not. To take a trenchant example, before the Carboniferous or
thereabouts, the vertebrates had not realized their possibilities of
terrestrial existence--nearly half the globe’s surface lay waiting to
be colonized by backboned animals. The earth’s surface was conquered
then--but the air remained unsubdued before the mid-Secondary. In every
period, there must be not only actual gaps unfilled in the economy of
nature--such and such an animal is without parasites, such and such
a hot spring or salt lake is without tenants; but also improvements
can be made in existing types of organization--a tapeworm could be
more firmly attached, a salt-lake shrimp could tolerate an even higher
concentration of brine.

These two sorts of possibilities really overlap. For instance, an
increased efficiency of vision must be an improvement in pre-existing
structures and creatures; it also involves the conquest of new regions
of environment, and so in a real sense the occupation of a new
biological niche.

In any case, the changes which would confer advantage in the struggle
for existence may take place in any direction--with, or against, or at
right angles to the stream of progress. By means of those which march
with that stream, the upper level of life’s attainment is raised.
But the struggle still goes on: and again, starting from this new
condition, there will be variations in every direction which will have
survival value, and some of these will be progressive; and so the
upper level will be once more raised.

The process will take time, for, whatever theory of variation we may
hold[8]--the old idea of small continuous variations; or that of large
mutations big enough to produce new species at one jump; or the most
probable theory of numerous small mutations--they one and all must
grant that the largest variation occurring at one time in a living
species is infinitesimal in comparison with the secular changes of
evolution.

There will further be a premium upon progressive changes, since a
progressive change will generally land its possessor in virgin soil,
so to speak; if not in an actually new physical environment, then in a
biologically new situation. The placental mammal occupies the same dry
land as did the wonderful reptilian types of the Secondary epoch. But
constant temperature and embryonic nutrition within its mother provide
delicately adjusted conditions in the early phases of development which
in their turn enabled a more elaborate and more delicately responding
brain machinery to be constructed in development, and so advanced their
possessors on to new shores of control and independence.

There will thus be a constant biological pressure (to use a term
which, though still symbolic, a mere analogy, is less misleading and
question-begging than _élan vital_) tending to push some of life on
to new levels of attainment, new steps in progress, _because_ any
variations in that direction will have selection value, a selection
value above the ordinary. And the process will be a gradual one,
because variations are not very large; so that life no more realizes
all potentialities of progress at once than did the United States or
any other new country receive a uniform population over all its extent
as soon as it was discovered, but had its people move in from the
coasts in a regular and orderly advance.

There are plenty of parallels from human affairs. Indeed, the
evolutionist can often gain valuable light on his subject, on what
one may call the economics of the process, by turning to study the
development of human inventions and machines. There, although the
ways in which variations arise, and the way they are transmitted, are
different from those of organic evolution, yet the type of “pressure,”
the perpetual struggle, and the advantage of certain kinds of variation
therein--these are in essence really similar.

What could be more striking than the parallel between the rise of the
mammals to dominance over the reptiles, and the rise of the motor
vehicle to dominance over that drawn by horses?

In both cases, a comparatively long period in which the new type is in
a precarious and experimental stage, only just managing to exist, of
small size and rare occurrence, and in no real sense a serious rival to
its old-established competitors. Then, suddenly, a change. It reaches
a level at which it can effectively compete with them. What happens?
In the case both of man-made machine and evolving vertebrate group,
there is first a sudden increase in numbers of the new, a corresponding
decrease in numbers of the old type. The upper level of size of the
new type also begins to increase, and it begins to split up into a
great number of differentiated sub-types. Some of these sub-types
become extinct, others, on the other hand, are gradually improved,
while still others undergo such rapid change as to merit the style of
new sub-types. The upper level of size, complexity, and efficiency
increase, both in animal and machine.

It is as well to remember that survival-value means only what it says.
A variation with survival-value helps its possessors to survive: it
is not the best possible variation of the kind. In the developing
motor-car, the substitution of four for one or two cylinders was a
great improvement. It had “survival-value”; and not until the majority
of cars came to be four-cylindered was the additional advantage of
six or eight cylinders large enough to bring them into existence as
dominant types.

To the interrelated evolution of carnivore and herbivore, again,
leading to increase of size and speed in both, of wariness in one, of
tooth and claw in the other, we have again a close parallel in the
interrelated evolution of armour-plating and of projectiles. Here
again the process is gradual. We can further see that the sudden
“development” of full modern armour on the first iron-clad would
have been actually disadvantageous, since it would have reduced
its speed relatively to other less heavily protected ships, without
conferring any corresponding benefit in the way of defence against the
comparatively inefficient projectiles of the day. Only when the range
and piercing power of the projectiles increased did increase of armour
become imperative.

To resume our pressure analogy, the natural increase of all organisms
leads to a “biological pressure.” So long as a species remains
unchanged, so long must it stay subjected to the full force of this
pressure. But if it changes in such a way that it can occupy a new
niche in environment, it is expanding into a vacuum or a region of
lower pressure. Natural increase soon fills this up to the same level
of pressure, and conditions thus become favourable for expansion into
new low-pressure areas previously out of reach of the normal range
of variation. Variation towards such “low-pressure” regions may be
progressive, retrogressive, or neutral: but it is obvious that at
each stage of evolution there will always be a low-pressure fringe,
representing a considerable fraction of the “low-pressure” area within
the range of variability, the occupation of which would be biologically
progressive.

Thus from the well-established biological premisses of (1) the tendency
to geometrical increase with consequent struggle for existence,
(2) some form of inherited variability, we can deduce as necessary
consequence, not only the familiar but none the less fundamental
fact of Natural Selection, but also the almost neglected fact that
a _certain fraction_ of the guiding force of Natural Selection will
inevitably be pushing organisms into changes that are progressive.

This will of course be true only so far as the general conditions of
the environment remain within certain limits: it is probable that too
great reductions of temperature or moisture on the surface of the
earth would lead to a gradual reversal of progress before the final
extinction of life. Up to the present, however, it is clear that such
conditions have not occurred, or, possibly, have occurred only for
short periods. The general state has been one in which steady, slow
progress has been achieved. Progress, like adaptation, is in pre-human
evolution almost entirely the resultant of blind chance and blind
necessity.

What corollaries and conclusions may be drawn from the establishment
of the fact of biological progress? In the first place, it permits us
to treat human progress as a special case of a more general process.
Biologically speaking, the human species is young--not perhaps still
in infancy, but certainly not yet attained to any stable maturity.
The conception, common enough in much traditional thought, that man
as a species is old, far removed from all pristine vigour and power,
is demonstrably untrue. The genus Homo has not yet adapted itself
to the new conditions and the new possibilities arising out of the
acquisition of reason and tradition. Its history so far is a record of
experiment after experiment. From a period so short and so empirical
it is impossible to deduce any general law of progress. In certain
respects, as we shall see more in detail later, there has been advance;
in others, the species has been stationary. But whether humanity in
this or that particular has progressed is for the moment comparatively
immaterial. Humanity is part of life, a product of life’s movement; and
in life as a whole there is progress.[9]

What is more, there was progress before man ever appeared on the earth,
and its reality would have been in no way impaired even if he had never
come into being. His rise only continued, modified, and accelerated a
process that had been in operation since the dawn of life.

Here we find, in the intellectual sphere at least, that assurance which
men have been seeking from the first. We see revealed, in the fact of
evolutionary progress, that the forces of nature conspire together to
produce results which have value in our eyes, that man has no right
to feel helpless or without support in a cold and meaningless cosmos,
to believe that he must face and fight forces which are definitively
hostile. Although he must attack the problems of existence in a new
way, yet his face is set in the same direction as the main tide of
evolving life, and his highest destiny, the end towards which he has so
long perceived that he must strive, is to extend to new possibilities
the process with which, for all these millions of years, nature has
already been busy, to introduce less and less wasteful methods, to
accelerate by means of his consciousness what in the past has been the
work of blind unconscious forces. “In la sua volontade è nostra pace.”

For this is one of the most remarkable facts of evolution--that
consciousness, until a very late period, has played in it a negligible
part. Indeed the rise of consciousness to become a factor of importance
in evolution has been one of the most notable single items of progress.
Darwin gave the deathblow to teleology by showing that apparently
purposive structures could arise by means of a non-purposive mechanism.
“Purpose” is a term invented to denote a particular operation of the
human mind, and should only be used where a psychological basis may
reasonably be postulated. On the other hand, a result can be attained
by conscious purpose without the waste of time and of living material
needed by the indirect method of natural selection; and thus the
substitution of purposed for unpurposed progress is itself a step in
progress.

As another corollary of our concept of progress, it follows that we
can and should consider, not only the direction of any evolutionary
process, but also its rate.

An evolutionary process, if it is to be considered progressive, must
have a component in one particular direction--a direction which we have
already defined. But this is not all; for even if it be moving in the
right direction, and yet be moving extremely slowly, it may, if it have
any interaction with a much more rapid progressive movement, actually
exert a drag on this; its relative motion--relative to the main current
of progress--will be backwards, and we may have to class it as the
reverse of progressive. For example, the interaction of carnivore and
herbivore, pursuer and pursued, led during the development of the
vertebrates to the evolution of much that was good--speed, strength,
alertness, and acuity of sense--and of many noble types of living
things. But with the advent of man, different methods have been
introduced, new modes of competition and advance; and the tiger and
the wolf not only cease to be agents of progress in its new form,
but definitely stand in its way and must be stamped out, or at least
reduced to a condition in which they can no longer interfere as active
agents in evolution.

Some such considerations as these will help perhaps to resolve various
difficulties of ethics--how, for instance, that which seems good to me
may seem evil to another. Even the good, if it be a drag on the better,
is evil. Expressed thus, the proposition is a paradox; but expressed in
terms of direction and relative speed, it is at once intelligible.

But the test of any such general biological theory as I have outlined
will be its application to human problems. And here too, I venture to
say, the value of biological method is apparent. What we ask, and
rightly ask, is whether in the laws of biological progress we can find
any principle which we can apply directly to guide us in devising
methods for human progress.

I do not propose to follow the example of many rather hasty
philosophers and biologists, who have thought that, whenever the
study of lower organisms permitted the promulgation of a biological
law, such law can be lifted bodily from its context and be applied
without modification to human affairs. Man is an organism--but a very
exceptional and peculiar organism. Any biological law which epitomizes
only facts about the lower creatures is not a general biological law,
for general biological laws must take account not only of plants and
animals, but of man as well. In practice, however, the simplest method
is to frame our biological laws without considering man, and then to
see in what way they must be modified if they are to be applied to him.

Man differs biologically from other organisms in the following main
ways. First, he has the power of thinking in concepts; in other words,
his power of learning by experience is not always conditioned directly
by the accidents of his own life, as is the case with animals endowed
only with associative memory, but he can, by reaching the general from
the special, attain to the possibility of dealing with many more, and
more complicated, eventualities. Next, by means of speech, writing,
and printing, he has developed a new mode of inheritance.[10] Each
community, and indeed humanity as a whole, transmits its peculiarities
to later ages by means of tradition, using that word in its largest
sense. Physical inheritance of the same type as in all higher animals
and plants is the necessary basis, but the distinctive characters
of any civilization are based on this new tradition-inheritance.
Thirdly, the type of mind which has been evolved in man is much more
plastic--a much more elastic and flexible mechanism than any tool
previously evolved by life for handling the problems of existence. As
a consequence of this we have the substitution of general educability
for specific instincts. For the power of performing comparatively
few actions smoothly and without trouble, there is exchanged the
possibility of a vastly increased range of action, but one which
has to be learnt. As another consequence, man has come by the
power--impossible to any other organism--of leading what is to all
intents and purposes a multiple existence. It is for this very reason
difficult to fit man into many of the ordinary biological categories.
The physical and mental structure and the mode of life of even the
highest of the animals are for all practical purposes a fixed quantity.
An ant, for all its delicacy of adjustment, is little less than a
sentient cog shaped to fit in just one way into the machinery of the
community; a dog, for all his power of learning, is tied down and
imprisoned within a rigidity and narrowness of bodily and mental
organization difficult for us to imagine.

Man passes freely from one aggregation to another. He can
change his nation or his city; he can belong to a dozen
organizations--biologically speaking, can be aggregated in a dozen
different ways--and play a different part as unit in each. He can
follow one profession in the morning, another at night, and be a
hobby-horse rider in between.

This plastic mind has endowed him with a new biological possibility.
He can do what no other organism can--he can be both specialized and
generalized at one and the same time.

In biology, the aggregation of units to form units of higher grade has
been always followed by division of labour among the units; and this
division of labour has, in all infrahuman history, been made possible
only by an irreversible specialization.[11] A soldier-ant is a soldier,
and there its possibilities end. It cannot do what the worker or
the queen can do. A muscle-cell, because it has gained the power to
contract, is cut off from other possibilities; it cannot secrete, or
digest, or carry messages. The aggregate of nerve-cells which makes the
physical basis of mind is held fixed to its post, incapable of turning
to other functions.

It follows that the units of all such aggregates are subordinate to
the whole--they have lost their independence, and can often no longer
be considered as individuals at all, except historically. But in man,
none of these things hold. A man can for half his day be the merest
cog, subordinate in every detail of his action to the needs of the
community, but for the other half be himself, a full and complete
individuality, making the community serve his own ends and needs. For
him, aggregation does not mean complete and irreversible subordination;
his specialization is reversible, and indeed his potentialities as an
individual actually increase with the increased individuality of the
aggregate to which he belongs.

Bearing these differences in mind, we may turn to consider how our
doctrine of progress helps us in studying humanity.

At the outset we must guard ourselves against the idea that human
society has reached any high level of biological individuation. I may
perhaps quote from what I have written elsewhere: “If we were to draw a
parallel between primitive types of society and some primitive mammal
such as a duck-billed platypus, and to compare the course which we
hope society will in time accomplish with what has been accomplished
in the progress of the mammalian type from a creature resembling the
platypus up to man, with what creature should we have to compare the
existing state of human communities? I venture to say that we should be
flattering ourselves if we were to fix upon the dog.”

Then we must remember that Natural Selection in man has fallen chiefly
upon groups, not upon individuals, and differences in the nature and
organization of human groups are determined chiefly by what we can
best sum up as differences of tradition in the widest sense of the
term. The later history of mankind, from a period long antedating
written records, has been one of the rapid rise and equally rapid
extinction, not only of one group-unit after another, but of one type
of group-unit after another. It is further obvious at first glance that
the group-units, the types of society which are at present dominant,
are far from perfect and far from stable, and indeed that they are
evolving, with speed of change hitherto unsurpassed, towards new and
unknown forms.

When the mammalian type first became dominant on the globe--at the
transition between the Secondary and Tertiary periods--a somewhat
similar history was passed through. The new type of organization gave
its possessors marked advantages over other animal types: but the full
potentialities of the mammal (excluding man) were not realized until
well over half of the Tertiary period had elapsed, and man was being
prepared in the womb of circumstance. The Pliocene sees the triumph
of the perfected types of mammal: the preceding Miocene, broadly
speaking, sees the first rise of these new types, while the Eocene and
Oligocene show us a rapid rise and as rapid extinction of variation
upon variation on the original theme.[12] With man, however, only the
beginnings of a similar process have as yet come to pass.

Further, we must distinguish clearly between the different ways in
which progress may be operative in man. In the first place it can
appear, as we have just pointed out, in the organization of the
communities to which he belongs and on which natural selection seems
mainly to act. Secondly, it can appear as a raising of the _average_ of
certain qualities among the individuals composing those communities.
And thirdly, it can appear as a raising of the _upper level_ of
attainment in those qualities, in the appearance of individuals
biologically higher than any that have previously existed.

This last point may be first dealt with. It has often been urged as
an argument against the doctrine of progress that we can trace no
advance in the capabilities of the individual man throughout history,
and it has even been asserted that no such advance has occurred during
pre-history. To this latter criticism there is the obvious reply that
at some period there was an origin of human from non-human organisms,
and that during the period of transition at least (and probably for a
considerable time afterward) there naturally must have been a raising
of the upper level of attainments, and still more of possibility. The
main point at issue, however, is not to be gainsaid. It appears[13]
that comparatively early in the evolution of man, there appeared, in
some branches of the stock, a type of mental organization which has
not yet been improved upon. An individual possessing it is capable,
when developing in proper environment (the most important single
elements of which are the organization and tradition of the community
to which he belongs) of attaining to possibilities which, measured in
terms of the potentialities of any previous organism, are wellnigh
boundless. He can survey the whole of mankind, penetrate the future
with prophecy, bring the gamut of experience within a work of art,
discover the laws by which the universe operates. Judged thus, Goethe
is no greater and no less great than Leonardo, Shakespeare than Dante
or Æschylus, Darwin than Pasteur, Kant than Plato.

The best type of human mind operating to the best advantage, is
introduced to possibilities so vast in comparison with its paltry span
of existence that it can never realize more than a fraction of them.
Furthermore, since the incidence of natural selection has fallen, from
long before historical time, upon the community and its traditions far
more than upon the individual, and since the conditions under which
the possibilities of the individual can be even qualitatively realized
have been rarely forthcoming, it is not surprising that the level of
possibility itself has not been raised. Indeed, only too often there
has been reversed selection, and the exceptional man has suffered from
his exceptional endowments.

There is no theoretical objection whatever to the idea that new
types of mind, new modes of thought, new levels of attainment, could
be reached by life: the mental difference between low types of men
and men of genius is almost as great as that between man and ape.
The difference in practical intelligence between a hen, a dog, a
chimpanzee, and a man is largely a difference in the complexity of the
situations which can be grasped as a whole so that the right way out
is adopted as the result of this unitary comprehension.[14] There is
no reason to doubt that other types of mental mechanism are possible
which would make our grasp of complex situations appear pitiful and
hen-like in its limitations, which would enable their possessors to
_see_ and solve in a flash where we can only grope and guess or at best
calculate laboriously and step by step. But this will not take place,
first until the community-environment is made as favourable as possible
for such development, and secondly until there is begun a deliberate
biological encouragement of new possibilities of intuition, say, or of
communication between mind and mind.

As regards the second point, the raising of the average as opposed to
the upper level of attainment, not much need be said. That part of
our civilization which can be thought of as progressive is largely
concerned with this very thing--with making it possible for men to
realize in larger measure their inherent possibilities. Further, in
so far as there exists selection within the community, it largely,
under present conditions, encourages qualities such as intelligence
and initiative, which are biologically progressive. And finally, when
Eugenics shall become practical politics, its action, so far as we can
see, will be at first entirely devoted to this raising of the average,
by altering the proportion of good and bad stock, and if possible
eliminating the lowest strata, in a genetically mixed population.[15]

Since, however, the main stress in human evolution has been upon the
community and upon tradition, it is here that we shall expect to find
most definite evidences of progress, and it is here that we do in fact
find them.

We have in the first place the increase of the size of units, familiar
to us already in lower forms. This, however, is tending to a limit,
which will be attained when the present competition of sovereign states
has been replaced (as, if we can read the future from the past, it
inevitably will be) by some form of federation covering the globe.
We find an immense increase of control over environment--a theme so
hackneyed as to need no labouring. We find an almost equally striking,
if less spectacular, increase in independence. Man becomes less and
less at the mercy of the forces of nature and of other organisms,
attains much more to self-regulation. This has depended upon increased
efficiency of “organs”--here the extra-organismal organs we call
tools and machines; and upon increased rapidity and certainty of
communication both within and between units. There has been an almost
overwhelming increase (displaying too not a uniform but an accelerated
motion) of knowledge, of the possibilities of acquiring new knowledge,
and of what may be called the “group-memory”--the power of storing
and rendering knowledge available, and this in its turn brings about
a huge increase in the size of the environment with which man either
physically or mentally comes into contact.

As regards increase of harmony or co-ordination, human communities
have advanced but little, although in the increase of powers of
communication there has been laid the foundation for such possibility.

That this lack of progress is partly due to the extreme rapidity of
change in type of unit and of the units’ increase in size, is not
doubtful; a further ground for it, however, is to be found in the fact
that human societies present a new biological problem, in so much as
it is impossible, man being what he is, to solve the relationship of
individual and community, of smaller and larger unit, in the simple
way in which it has always been solved before--by specialization and
subordination of the individuals.[16] The early development of codes of
law, codes of ritual, and codes of morals represents the first attempt
at a solution of the problem: the modern rise of arbitration as a
method of settling disputes between whole units and large groups within
units is another important step in the same direction. Nevertheless, it
is here that the most drastic change of method will have to be brought
into being if man’s development is to continue progressive.

There is, however, a weighty criticism of the validity of human
progress. Granted that human science and invention have made enormous
strides, that knowledge has increased and convenience multiplied--is
_man_, the living, feeling, personal human being, any the better in
essentials for all of this--has it not merely made life more complex at
the expense of its depth, more rapid at the expense of its tranquillity
and suavity? This is especially obvious in the field of art. It is
impossible to maintain that any one of a certain number--a hundred, or
perhaps a thousand--of great poets, painters, sculptors, or musicians
is greater or has achieved finer things than any other of the number.
What is more, in most arts--notably sculpture, painting, and poetry,
the possibilities of expression and achievement do not increase, and
once a certain pitch of skill is reached, tend to extinguish themselves
in technique and virtuosity. When this happens, new ideas generally
come upon the scene and work up again from a relatively primitive to a
complicated technique along a more or less different path--and so on
and so forth _ad infinitum_.

This is not so true of architecture, and still less so of music. In
intellectual matters it is clearly not true of mathematics, where
each advance provides the foundation for the solution of more complex
problems, nor, similarly, of much of science. But even in this
intellectual domain, where the accumulation of knowledge is so evident,
where the increasing difficulty and complexity of the problems soluble
and solved is so remarkable--even here the individual achievement can
scarcely be properly said to increase, certainly not the individual
merit or the individual satisfaction. Newton’s achievement was no less
splendid because to-day any fourth-rate mathematician can use the
calculus, nor Euclid’s for that his discoveries can be explained to
every schoolboy; while for Harvey to discover the circulation of the
blood or for Dalton to demonstrate the particulate nature of matter
was certainly no slighter task than that needed to show the reality of
internal secretion or to discover the infra-atomic world of electrons.
The task occupied all their powers, its accomplishment satisfied them;
and the powers themselves have not increased--only the ways in which
men have learned to use them.

This criticism has been partly dealt with before. We have seen that
the present organization of human mind introduces its possessor to
a practical infinitude of possibility. We have also seen that there
is no theoretical obstacle to be seen at present to an increase of
human powers, be it in range of comprehension, intensity of feeling,
or brilliance of intuition. More to our present purpose is the reply
that, whereas in all these ways the inherent capabilities have not
increased, yet the opportunities of realizing these capabilities have
for the bulk of the population increased--in particular, for instance,
of gratifying the more complex and the more intellectual emotions,
with the multiplication of theatres, of books, of pictures, of
concerts. Here, for once, the average has advanced more than the upper
level. Whatever overstress and maladjustment the complexity of modern
civilization has brought with it, it has certainly made it easier for
more men and women to realize more of their potentialities now than a
thousand years ago, and far more than a hundred thousand years ago.

There are, then, these facts to set on the credit side of Progress’
balance-sheet. It is easy enough to see items on the debit side, and
indeed to be so horrifiedly fascinated by it as not to have eyes
for anything else. Human history is in one view but a long record
of suffering, oppression, and folly. Slavery, torture, religious
persecution, war, pestilence and famine, the greed of those who
possess power, the dirt and sloth and ignorance of those who do
not--the elements of the picture keep on recurring, if not in the old
forms, then in new ones. Pain, disease, disappointment, and death are
inevitable. Even when a civilization seems to be progressing, there
always comes a time when it passes its zenith and topples through
decay or defect to ruin. How is it possible to speak of progress
when at this present moment there are vast poverty-stricken and slum
populations with all the great nations, and when these same great
nations have just been engaged in the most appalling war in history?

It is a formidable indictment: but I venture to assert that it can be
met by the same argument with which, in the realm of biology, was met
the argument from degeneration.

Such facts show at once that any idea of inevitable or of universal
progress is untenable, the product of an irrational idealism which
prefers its own desires to reality. They show further that, up to
the present, suffering and pain on the one hand, and on the other
degeneration in a certain number of individuals, are as universal and
apparently inevitable in human as in animal evolution. But they do not
show that some sort of progress may not have occurred--not necessarily
the kind of progress that some of us would like, not necessarily as
rapid as could be desired, but yet indubitably and solidly Progress. We
have seen that in the hundreds of thousands of species which constitute
life, that which has been increased most obviously is the upper level
of certain qualities--primitive forms have persisted, degenerate forms
have arisen side by side with and in spite of the steady improvement in
the highest types. This has happened in man also.

The upper level of control and of independence in human group-units,
and in a certain number of fortunate individuals, has obviously
increased; but there are the slums, there are the drab lives of
thousands in great cities, there are poverty, degeneracy, and crime.
All that we can say is that to many at least it seems theoretically
possible that man should be able to reduce the amount of degeneration,
waste, and pain, to increase the changes to be summed up as progressive.

The future Golden Age of Millenniarism is as impossible a notion
as the past Golden Age of Mythology, and more demoralizing. Bury,
with pardonable sarcasm, speaks of the result hoped for in it as “a
menagerie of happy men ... in which the dynamic character of history
disappears.” But once we have accepted (as the great majority accept)
life as somehow worth living, the belief in progress asserts only
(though there is much in that “only”) that life may be made more worth
living to a larger proportion of people, although effort and failure
always will and always must be conditions of its operation. As Goethe
said, “Let humanity last as long as it will, there will always be
hindrances in its way, and all kinds of distress, to make it develop
its powers.”

It is important to remember, what we have already noted, that the
history of mankind is largely the history of competition between
group-units or communities. When rare communities have been able to
escape from this race of competition and have deliberately devoted the
energy and resources thus set free to better community-regulation and
an improvement in the lives of the individuals composing them, then,
like Denmark, they have moved rapidly along a path of real progress.
Once an efficient federation of communities has come into being,
Progress can knock at the door with some chance of being admitted. In
general, it is enough for our present purpose to have shown that some
modicum of progress has occurred within the species Man; and that some
of the characteristics which most saliently mark him off from other
organisms--his powers of generalization and his self-consciousness--are
in themselves germs, potentialities of great progress in the future,
because through them blind biological progress can become economical,
foreseeing, and conscious of herself.

There remains for me only one task--to investigate more closely the
relation of that fact of evolutionary direction which we have called
biological progress, to our ideas of value. What we have found is that
there exists a certain general direction of movement in the evolution
of living things; towards the increase of certain of their properties.
But when we make a further analysis, we find that movement in this
direction is movement towards a realization of the things judged by the
human mind to have value. It is movement towards an increase of power,
of knowledge, of purpose, of emotion, of harmony, of independence.
Increases in these faculties combine, once a certain stage in mental
development is reached, to mean the embracing of ever larger syntheses
by the organism possessing them--practical syntheses, as in business,
or exploration, or administration; intellectual, as in philosophy or in
the establishment of scientific laws; emotional, as in love or in the
passion for nature; artistic, as in a symphony or great drama. These
capabilities are greater in man than in the higher animals, in the
higher animals than in the lower, more and more windows being closed
and powers pruned away as we descend the scale.

It is immaterial whether the human mind comes to have these values
_because_ they make for progress in evolution, or whether things which
make for evolutionary progress become significant _because_ they happen
to be considered as valuable by human mind, for both are in their
degree true. There is an interrelation which cannot be disentangled,
for it is based on the fundamental uniformity and unity of the cosmos.
What is important is that the human idea of _value_ finds its external
counterpart in an actual historical _direction_ in phenomena, and that
each becomes more important because of the relationship.

Much of what I have written will appear obvious. But if it has been
obvious, it will be because I have here attempted to focus attention on
some of the corollaries of a single fundamental truth--so obvious that
it often escapes notice, but so fundamental that its results cannot but
fail to obtrude themselves upon us. I mean the unity of phenomena--not
merely the unity of life, put on a firm footing for all time by Darwin,
though that is for my purpose the most important, but the unity of
living and non-living, demanding a monistic conception of the universe.
For the present, the stellar host (possibly, as recent astronomy
seems to assert, assembled not in one system but in a multiplicity of
universes, floating through space like a shoal of jelly-fishes in a
Mediterranean bay)--the stars seem alien from our life, alien or at
best neutral. All that links us to them is that we are built of the
same stuff, the same elements.

But the last half-century has at least enlarged our view so that we
can perceive that we, as living things, are not alien to the rest of
life--that we march in the same direction, and that our hostility to
and struggles with other organisms are in part but the continuation
of the old struggle, in part the expression of the fact that we have
acquired new methods for dealing with the problems of existence.

The origin of life itself, and its movement in time--both these are
found to face in the same direction as ourselves. St. Paul wrote that
all things work together for good. That is an exaggeration: but they
work together so that the average level of the good is raised, the
potentialities of life are bettered. In every time and every country,
men have obscurely felt that, although so much of the world, taken
singly, was evil, yet the clash of thing with thing, process with
process, the working of the whole, somehow led to good.

This feeling is what I believe is clarified and put on a firm
intellectual footing by biology. The problems of evil, of pain, of
strife, of death, of insufficiency and imperfection--all these and
a host of others remain to perplex and burden us. But the fact of
progress emerging from pain and battle and imperfection--this is an
intellectual prop which can support the distressed and questioning
mind, and be incorporated into the common theology of the future.

Dean Inge, in his Romanes Lectures,[17] quotes Disraeli’s caustic
words, “The European talks of progress because by the aid of a few
scientific discoveries he has established a society which has mistaken
comfort for civilization,” and quotes them with approval. He bitterly
criticizes what we may sum up as Millenarianism (although this after
all is but a crude and popular aspiration after what the Christian
would call the Kingdom of God on earth). And, after exalting Hope as a
virtue, closes with the somewhat satirical statement, “It is safe to
predict that we shall go on hoping.”

He has been so concerned to attack the dogma of inherent and
inevitable progress in human affairs that he has denied the fact
of progress--whether inevitable we know not, but indubitable and
actual--in biological evolution: and in so doing he has cut off
himself and his adherents from one of the ways in which that greatest
need of man which we spoke of at the outset can be satisfied, from by
far the greatest manifestation in external things of “something, not
ourselves, that makes for righteousness.”

One word more, and I have done. There remains in some ways the hardest
problem of all. The greatest experiences of human life, those in which
the mind appears to touch the Absolute and the Infinite--what of
their relation to this notion of progress? They are realized in many
forms--in love, in intellectual discovery, in art, in religion; but the
salient fact about all is that they are felt as of intensest value,
and that they seem to leave no more to be desired. Doubtless when we
say that at such moment we touch the Infinite or the Absolute we mean
only that we touch what is infinite and absolute in comparison with our
ordinary selves. None the less, the sense of finality and utter reality
attendant on them is difficult to bring into line with our idea of
progress.


     “I saw Eternity the other night
     Like a great ring of pure and endless light,
     All calm, as it was bright.”


The Dean too has felt this so strongly that he has made it the keystone
of his argument. As he says, “Spiritual progress must be within the
sphere of a reality which is not itself progressing, or for which in
Milton’s grand words ‘progresses the dateless and irrevoluble circle
of its own perfection, joining inseparable hands with joy and bliss in
over-measure for ever.’”

I would only suggest that for many to attain to such experiences,
which in truth seem to constitute the highest satisfaction at present
conceivable for men on earth, it is necessary to organize the community
and to plan out life in such a way that human beings, released from the
unnecessary burdens of hunger, poverty, and strife, are not only free
but helped and urged to attain to such Delectable Mountains. Spiritual
progress is our one ultimate aim; it may be towards the dateless and
irrevoluble; but it is inevitably dependent upon progress intellectual,
moral, and physical--progress in this changing, revolving world of
dated events.
