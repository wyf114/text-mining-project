SEX BIOLOGY AND SEX PSYCHOLOGY


                  SEX: THREE WAYS

     That body has for soul an air-balloon
       Which drifts with every spiritual blast,
       Doomed, swollen thing! to leak or burst at last
     Though overmuch aspiring toward the moon.

     This other soul, below the animal,
       Bloating and coating body’s baser parts
       With the manure of its desires and arts,
     Helps flesh to grow still more corporeal.

     I pray that I may still inhabit earth,
       Where grass invites the foot, and roses smell;
       Yet shall I lead my body on to dwell
     In the eternal land of second birth,
     If, nought contemned, each part of being’s whole
     Is taken up in my transmuting soul.




SEX BIOLOGY AND SEX PSYCHOLOGY[27]


     “And now I see with eye serene
     The very pulse of the machine.”
                         --W. WORDSWORTH.


     “There is reason to believe that the processes which underlie
     all great work in art, literature, or science take place
     unconsciously, or at least unwittingly. It is an interesting
     question to ask whence comes the energy of which this work is the
     expression. There are two chief possibilities: one, that it is
     derived from the instinctive tendencies which, through the action
     of controlling forces, fail to find their natural outlet; the
     other, that the energy so arising is increased in amount through
     the conflict between controlled and controlling forces.”--W. H.
     RIVERS.


The biology of sex is a vast subject. Not only are there questions of
sex-determination, but the whole sexual selection problem has to be
considered, together with the evolutionary function of sex, and its
first origin. I can only attempt, in the short space at my disposal, to
deal with one or two of the chief points, and only in so far as they
bear on questions of human sex psychology.

In the first place, then, we have to consider the evolutionary history
of sex. Of its origin we can say only that it is veiled in complete
obscurity. Once present, however, it appears to have a definite
function by making possible, through sexual reproduction, all the
various combinations of any heritable variations that may arise
in different individuals of a species, and so conferring greater
evolutionary plasticity on the species as a whole.[28]

Primarily, sex implies only the fusion of nuclei from two separate
individuals; there is no need for sex differences to exist at all. Sex
differences, however, are almost universal in sexually-reproducing
organisms, and represent a division of labour between the active male
cell and the passive female cell, the former taking over the task of
uniting the two, the latter storing up nutriment for the new individual
that will result from that union.

The subsequent history of sex is, roughly speaking, the history of its
invasion of more and more of the organization of its possessors. First
the male as a whole, and not merely its reproductive cells, tends to
become organized for finding the female. The female’s whole type of
metabolism is altered to produce the most efficient storage of reserve
material in her ova, and later she almost invariably protects and
nourishes the young during the first part of their development, either
within or without her own body. Appropriate instincts are of course
developed in both male and female.

At the outset there is enormous waste incurred in the liberation of
sperms and ova into the water, there to unite as best they may.
Congress of the sexes eliminates the major part of this waste, and is
universal above a certain level. This is in itself the basis for other
changes. As the mind, or shall we say the psycho-neural organization,
becomes more complex, the sexual instinct becomes more interwoven with
the general emotional state; and a large number of animals appear not
to mate unless their emotional state has been raised to a certain
level. The result of this is that special actions, associated generally
with bright colours or striking structures, with song or with scent,
come into being.

The exact mechanism of the appearance of these courtship-displays is a
much-vexed point; but it is undoubted that they only occur in animals
with congress of the sexes and with minds above a certain level of
complexity, and that they are employed in ceremonies between the two
sexes at mating-time. There can subsist no reasonable doubt that there
exists some causal connection between the associated facts.

An important point, which has been commonly overlooked, is that such
characters and actions may be either developed in one sex only, or in
both. In a large number of birds, such as egrets, grebes, cranes, and
many others, the courtship-displays are mutual, and the characters used
in them developed to a similar extent in both sexes. Such characters
are therefore often not secondary sexual differences, and we had best
use Poulton’s term _epigamic_ for them, whether they are developed in
one or in both sexes.[29]

The human species, in accordance with its complexity and flexibility
of brain, has epigamic characters of both kinds. Some, like voice and
moustache, are different in the two sexes, others, such as colour of
eyes and lips, the hairlessness of the body and grace of limbs and
carriage, are common to both.

In the vertebrate stock, two main lines of evolution as regards
sexual relationships may be traced. The first is predominant in
mammals: here, in most species, the female will not receive the male
except at fixed times, which are determined by a purely physiological
mechanism, the internal secretion of the gonad (reproductive organ).
Here we consequently find that the rule is for the males to fight for
the possession of the females, not to display before them. In the
monkeys, presumably as a result of a lessened dependence of mental
upon physiological processes, bright colours and special adornments of
various parts of the body are frequently developed.[30]

In the birds, on the other hand, although here too the internal
secretion of the gonad delimits a period in which alone congress of
the sexes can occur, it does not act for such a sharply-limited time
as in the mammal, nor is it so intense as completely to override
other components of the mind. As a result, general emotional stimulus
may play an important part in inducing readiness to pair, and we
accordingly find display of some sort, either by the male alone or by
both sexes, present in the great majority of species. It is at least
partly in correlation with this that beauty of voice and brilliant
appearance is far commoner in birds than in mammals.

The monkeys represent in some way a transitional stage towards that
seen in man, in whom the conditions have come to resemble those found
in birds, with consequent great development of epigamic characters and
actions of one sort and another, both physical and mental. Thus we see
that sex, after invading and altering the conformation of the body,
finally invades and alters the conformation of the mind.

As regards the other great biological question, of the determination of
sex, a very few words will suffice. In the first place I have no time
to consider plants or lower animals. In almost all higher animals that
have been investigated, however, there has been found some hereditary
mechanism for ensuring a rough constancy of sex-ratio. This mechanism
resides in the so-called _chromosomes_ of the nucleus. These exist
for the most part in similar pairs in both sexes: but one pair is
dissimilar in one sex. In mammals and man this sex is the male. Man
possesses one chromosome less than woman. He possesses only one member
of this pair of special sex-chromosomes, whereas she possesses two. All
her ova are alike in possessing one, whereas half his sperms possess
one, half possess none. Therefore, when the former kind of sperms
fertilize an ovum, two sex-chromosomes are present in the fertilized
egg and a female results; when the latter, only one, and the offspring
is male.[31]

Putting the matter in the broadest terms, we can say that there is a
different balance of hereditary factors in male and female, and that
this difference of balance dates from the moment of fertilization, and
normally determines sex.

Various agencies may alter the balance. The chromosomes themselves may
vary in what we must vaguely call their potency; or external agencies
may affect it. As a result, we sometimes obtain strange abnormal
individuals, in which the balance has been upset; in them development
results sometimes in organisms permanently intermediate between male
and female, sometimes in a change of sex at some period of development.

In insects the chromosomes appear to be predominant throughout life.
In vertebrates, however, they seem to play their chief rôle in early
development, ending by building up either a male or a female gonad in
the early embryo. This, once produced, takes over what remains of the
task of sex-determination. It secretes a specific internal secretion
which in a male acts so as to encourage the growth of male organs and
instincts, to suppress those of females; and vice versa in a female.

As a result of this difference we find that castration in insects, even
followed by engrafting of a gonad of opposite sex, produces no effect
upon other sexual characters; whereas it exerts a profound effect upon
mammals or birds.

As a second result, we find that in vertebrates the gonads form part
of what has been called the chemical directorate of the body--the
interlocking system of endocrine glands, each of which is exerting an
effect upon the rest. The importance of this is seen in the experiments
of Steinach, Sand, Voronoff, and others, who have been able to obtain
a rejuvenating effect in senile mammals by increasing, by various
methods, the amount of secreting reproductive organ in the body.[32]

To what then has our rapid survey led us? The actual origin of sex
is lost to us in the mists of a time inconceivably remote. Its
preservation once in existence, and its present all-but-universal
distribution seem to be definitely associated with the biological
advantage of the plasticity which it confers. Later, the primary
difference between male and female--their power of producing different
sorts of reproductive cells--leads on to secondary differences.
These differences may be biologically speaking non-significant, mere
accidents of the primary difference. Or they may be in the nature
of a division of labour between the sexes, this division of labour
usually concerning the protection of the embryo or the care of the
young, or more rarely the preservation of the individual itself. Or,
finally, they may concern the more efficient union of the gametes;
such differences may merely affect the ducts and apertures of the
reproductive system, and be more or less mechanical; or they may
concern the use of these systems, in the form of still mechanical
instincts, or they may be concerned in some way or other with the
emotional side of the animals, and consist in characters and actions
which stimulate the emotions of the other sex, characters which we have
termed epigamic.

It is only in higher groups that these emotion-stimulating sexual
characters arise, for only in them has mind reached a sufficient degree
of perfection. But even though detailed study reveals in a bird or a
mammal a mental life of a complexity far more considerable than the
average man would imagine, yet on the whole it is straightforward and
its currents run fairly direct from stimulus to fulfilment.

When we reach man, however, the whole aspect of the matter changes.
The change is most marked, naturally, in his mental organization.
Through his powers of rapid and unlimited association, any one part of
his experience can be combined with any other; through his powers of
generalizing and of giving names to things, his experience is far more
highly organized than that of any animal; through speech and writing he
is inheritor of a continuous tradition which enormously enlarges his
range of experience. Again, he can frame a purpose and thus put the
objective of his actions far further into the future than can lower
organisms.

There are, however, also changes of considerable biological importance
on the physical side. Man brings with him from his animal ancestors
the endocrine secretory mechanism of the reproductive organs: but his
life is not subordinated to it in such an iron-bound way. To start with
he has gradually lost all semblance of a breeding-season. Traces of
it survive in some primitive races, but in civilized communities all
one can say is that the number of births may show a slight seasonal
variation; and the reproductive organs are capable of function in all
twelve months of the year--a state of affairs known, I believe, in no
other vertebrate, or at least in no wild species.[33]

In the second place, there has been in the female a further
emancipation of the sexual life. In all other mammals the female will
only receive the male at certain well-defined periods, which in their
turn depend on cyclical changes in the ovaries. In man this restriction
has been overcome, and, in spite of the survival of a certain degree
of cyclical change in feeling, neither sex is restricted any longer
to certain physically-determined periods for the consummation of its
sexual life. This is, we may say, a triumph of mind over matter in the
human organism, of the mental elements of the sexual life over the
purely physical elements.

This is not to deny that the sexual life of man is dependent upon
the reproductive hormones. It is apparently necessary for proper
activation of the sexual centres in the brain that there should occur
a continuous liberation of secretion from the reproductive organs
into the blood. Again, the mental activities of man are so much more
important than those of other forms that even the cessation of activity
of the reproductive organs, for instance in the female at the change of
life, or even their total removal, need not prevent the continuation,
albeit in a modified form, of the sexual life in its varied indirect
manifestations.

Before attempting to probe the intricacies of the mental side of the
subject, we had better see what we can learn of the physical. Let
us first remind ourselves of one or two facts gained from animal
experimentation. In the first place, in mammals the activation of the
sexual instincts of one or the other sex appears to be completely
or almost completely under the control of the internal secretions
of the reproductive organs. Steinach and others have taken new-born
male guinea-pigs and have removed their testes and grafted ovaries
in their place. The result has been an animal almost completely
feminized both as regards body and mind. In some of the animals milk
was secreted, and when this occurred they would act as foster-mothers
to new-born guinea-pigs of other parents. The reverse operation, the
masculinization of females, was equally successful, the animals growing
large and showing all the instincts of a normal male and none of those
of a normal female.

A similar dependence of behaviour on gonad is seen in fowls. Here
nature makes a number of experiments, which have recently been studied
by Dr. Crew of Edinburgh. When the ovaries of a hen are affected by a
certain type of tumour, the bird stops laying, her comb and wattles
enlarge to the size of a cock’s, her spurs grow, she begins to crow,
her plumage changes at the moult and becomes cock-like, and finally
she becomes indistinguishable from a male. Indistinguishable, even in
behaviour: her years of feminine routine in laying and brooding are
forgotten: the secretion of the altered ovary now apparently resembles
that of a testis and stimulates centres of the brain which would
otherwise have remained permanently dormant. She struts and crows,
fights and mates, and the memory of the previous part of her life is
for all practical purposes lost, since the centres for female activity
are no longer stimulated at all.

Various workers have even experimentally produced a state of
hermaphroditism in mammals by simultaneous grafting of portions of
testes and ovary: the behaviour here oscillates between male and
female.[34]

It is quite clear from these and other facts that in higher vertebrates
there are present in every individual of either sex the nervous
connections which give the possibility of either male or female
behaviour; but that normally only one of these two possibilities is
realized, since for the potentiality of action given by the nervous
connections to become actual as behaviour it is necessary for the
nervous system to be activated by the secretion of one or other of
the reproductive organs. Castrated animals fail to realize either
possibility of normal sex-behaviour, although their nervous machinery
is untouched.

There are, further, some facts of observation which, even if they have
not yet been fully analysed by experiment, still throw light on the
matter. Although many of the most familiar birds--fowls, pheasant,
peacock, duck, finches, and so forth--have bright-coloured males and
drab females, with marked difference of behaviour between the sexes,
there are, as we have seen, many others, such as herons, divers, swans,
grebes, moorhens, and auks, in which the sexes are alike in plumage
and furthermore show what may be called a “mutual” courtship in which
both male and female play similar rôles. In this latter class it seems
clear that the secretions of the male and female reproductive organs
must be more alike than in the markedly dimorphic species: and this
is borne out by some strange facts regarding not merely the courtship
but the actions concerned with pairing itself. In the crested grebe
and the little grebe, for example, close observation has shown that
either member of the pair may assume the passive “female” attitude or
the active “male” attitude in pairing: and in the moorhen we meet with
the still more extraordinary phenomenon of double pairing, in which an
act of pairing with male and female in normal position is immediately
followed by a second act in which the normal position is reversed.[35]
It would appear in such cases that the similarity of male and female
internal secretion is so great that quite slight changes in nervous or
metabolic activity can cause the nervous centres for the opposite sex’s
mode of behaviour to become activated.

In human beings we are confronted with various grades of sexual
organization and behaviour besides the typically feminine and the
typically masculine. In the first place it is matter of common
knowledge that many women, who so far as their physical reproductive
capacity goes are perfectly normal, show various mental traits which
are more characteristic of men, and vice versa. What is more, the
“masculinoid” woman (to use the current jargon) tends physically
also to be less feminine, to have the feminine secondary sexual
characteristics in stature, form of skeleton, distribution of fat,
breasts, etc.--less strongly developed than normal, while the
“feminoid” man shows the reverse tendency.[36]

In trying to analyse these facts further, we are brought up against new
depths of complication. It is becoming ever clearer that the gonads do
not operate as independent organs, but in conjunction with the whole
of the rest of the endocrine system--thyroid, pituitary, adrenal, and
the rest. In the first place, it seems to be established that the
reproductive organs must be in some way activated by other ductless
glands before they become normal, just as they in their turn must
activate the sexual centres in the brain. This phase of the matter is
being investigated by many workers to-day; provisionally we may say
that pituitary and adrenal cortex are especially concerned. In the
second place the gonads, once activated and in normal working order,
react upon the other ductless glands. It thus comes about that the
relative proportion or relative activity of the parts of the whole
ductless gland system is different in male and female. Blair Bell is
the protagonist of this view. A woman is a woman, he says, not merely
because of her ovaries, but because of all her internal secretions, of
her endocrine balance as a whole.

It cannot be said that we have any certainty on the details of this
subject. It is clear, however, that some such fundamental difference
does exist, and it is therefore further probable that if a woman has a
thyroid, say, or an adrenal which for some reason (and there are many
possible reasons) is producing an amount of secretion abnormal for a
woman but more like that which is produced by a man, she will, in spite
of her ovaries, be more masculine in tendency.

I will content myself with one example. The cortex of the adrenal
gland, if active beyond a certain measure, assists the development
of male, prevents the development of female, characters. Women with
adrenal tumours frequently develop moustache and beard and other
appanages of the male. One presumes that a slight preponderance of the
adrenal cortex in the normal endocrine make-up will lead to a less
feminine type of woman than normal. I repeat that we are but on the
verge of the matter and that premature speculation is certainly risky
and probably fallacious. But all the same, there is very little doubt
that we are on the right track, and that we shall have to search for
the finer shades of temperamental difference between man and woman
not so much in differences in the quality of the secretion of testis
or ovary as in differences of balance in what the Americans call the
“endocrine make-up.”[37]

There is, however, also the possibility of difference in the quality
of gonad secretion, and of recent years Steinach and his followers
have been claiming that this may be at the bottom of many cases of
so-called “perversion of sexual instinct.” The latest claim of this
school is that homosexual men may be rendered heterosexual in instinct
by removal of their testes and implantation of a testis from a sexually
normal person--from a man, for example, who is being operated on for
cryptorchidism. It is frankly impossible as yet to say whether their
conclusions are well founded: a very much larger series of cases
will be necessary, and the possibility of suggestion’s action must
be eliminated. It is well to remember, however, that there is no
theoretical objection to the possibility. We know that in various
lower animals, such as moths and flies, the balance between the
male- and female-determining factors in the chromosomes may be altered
in certain crosses, and that this altered balance in the constitution
is reflected in some cases in a state permanently intermediate
between male and female, in others by a reversal of sex at some point
during development. For various reasons we should not usually expect
reversal in mammals; but if such abnormal balance should exist in the
constitution, as it well might, we should expect a gonad secreting an
abnormal, intermediate secretion. This we might also expect as the
result of certain accidents of embryonic life, as actually happens in
the abnormal female cattle known to farmers as free-martins. These
animals are always born co-twin to a male, and their abnormality is due
to the blood-systems of the embryonic membranes of the twins having
fused, so that the secretion of the developing male’s gonad acts upon
the developing female.

Further light on abnormally-directed sex-instinct is thrown by recent
analysis of abnormal domestic animals by Crew.[38] In both goats and
swine he finds that by far the commonest form of sexual abnormality is
one in which the external appearance, at least in youth, is so nearly
female as to raise no question in the mind of the casual observer;
about the time of maturity, however, male secondary sex characters
begin to develop, including male instincts; and dissection reveals
the presence of a double set of ducts--the female uterus and vagina,
the male epididymis and vas deferens, but only a single uniform
reproductive organ, and that always a testis. The simplest explanation
(although it is admittedly tentative) appears to be that the testis
has not been activated during embryonic and juvenile life, and that
therefore until puberty the animal, though really male, has been
physiologically in a neutral state, which permits the growth of the
internal apparatus proper to both sexes. Externally, the “neutral”
condition approximates more closely to the female type, and the animal
is thus first classed as a female. Some other gland is then responsible
for the second activation at puberty, and this occurs in a normal
manner.

This is of considerable interest, since it appears that in man too the
largest class of sexually abnormal individuals are those whose external
appearance is almost or quite feminine, but who possess male instincts.
It is at least probable that examination will show that they, too, or
many of them, will be of the type described above--males with delayed
activation of testis, a consequent classification as female at birth,
and a girl’s upbringing, with male instincts arising in the unhappy
creature at puberty.

It is the fashion nowadays to write down abnormal sexual psychology
wholly to the account of the mind, to an abnormal development with
causes entirely psychological. It is clear, however, that if some
abnormal individuals can be cured by implantation, and others are
abnormal owing to an early failure of activation, this conception falls
to the ground, and the Freudian is robbed of some of his most cherished
examples.

In any case, the work on animals definitely shows that, unless the
mechanism of activation of instinct by gonad secretion has altered
between animal and man more than we have any right to postulate a
priori, the quality of gonad secretion and the balance of all the
endocrines has to be taken into account far more than is done by the
average psycho-analyst.

This, however, is not to say that the genesis of our attitude towards
sex, our sexual behaviour, and our general mental organization in so
far as modified by sex, is not normally determined for the most part
by purely psychological causes. If there is a physical abnormality,
this will react upon the mental; but in the vast majority of cases
the physical variation will not take the individual beyond the limits
of normality, and when the normal physical limits are not exceeded,
the wide range of mental variation still observable is to be ascribed
to psychological causes. In other words, abnormal sexual behaviour
and instinct may be due either to physiological or psychological
abnormality, and the latter is probably the commoner cause.

I am not competent to attempt to treat of the vast and complex
psychological aspect of the sex-problem which the analytical
psychologists have opened up to such an extent within the last few
years; I can only deal with it in the broadest way, and content myself
rather with stating than with solving problems.

As regards the place of sex in our mental organization, there are two
contradictory extremes possible. Either all ideas connected with the
physical side of sex may be repressed with great vehemence, and the
sexual contribution to various emotions ignored or dismissed, while a
constant attempt is made at sublimation; or else there is little or no
repression beyond that necessitated by convention and custom, sexual
matters are taken at their physical face value, and sublimation is not
consciously attempted and exists only to a negligible amount.

There is no doubt that the first alternative represents one of the
commonest neuroses of modern life, and one in which an interpretation
on principles made familiar by psycho-analysis is the most
satisfactory. Repression, through whatever cause initiated (and
psychologists, I understand, are coming more and more to recognize
that chronic misuse of the mind as well as single violent shocks may
be effective), leads to a more or less complete dissociation of two
parts of the mind, of which one only is in the main connected with
the conscious personal life. As a result, curious phenomena are met
with. There is, it is true, a constant effort necessary to keep life
a-going with the aid of an incomplete mental organization; but when
satisfaction is attained, its very rarity brings with it a certain
glow, an irradiation of peculiarly pleasurable nature. Furthermore,
dissociation in most cases is not complete; now and again, and
especially when there is successful sublimation--in some people when in
love, in others with religious ecstasy, in others again with some form
of art--now and again re-association of the parts occurs, and there is
an extraordinary sense of the irruption of some vast beneficent force,
some great extra-personal flood of soul, into the meagre stream of
everyday life. The lives of a certain number of saints and ascetics,
mystics and poets, abound with phenomena of this sort; and apparently
the sense of value attaching to the occasional complete attainment of
such satisfactory states of the soul, combined with the conscious daily
quest for sublimation which is inevitable when the most important part
of the primitive emotions are repressed, is such a vivid experience
that it satisfies the mind and enables such persons to carry on, and to
do work sometimes of the highest value.

On the other hand, men and women with this type of mental development
naturally tend to be unstable; they cannot be sure of their capacity,
whether for routine work or creative thought or spiritual experience,
from day to day. Their mental life has a tendency to wear thin, their
sense of effort and struggle to increase and lead to breakdown. It
is in the long run an unsatisfactory way of organizing the psyche,
because the conscious mind has less than it ought to have upon which to
fall back.

The opposite extreme is equally unsatisfactory. If individuals of the
first type are trying to build high without adequate foundations, those
of the second are mistaking the foundations for a complete building.
A dissociation of a different type occurs in them--a dissociation due
to lack of use, to a mere failure to connect up that part of the mind
concerned with sexual emotion with a great many of the mind’s other
activities. Thus the sexual side has few and lower values associated
with it than it might, and other possibilities of thought and feeling
and action remain as mere possibilities, never realized in actuality.
The result is a definitely incomplete personality of a more or less
arrested or rudimentary type.

Those are the extremes: of course there are all intermediates between
them. They may crop up with apparent spontaneity, determined more
by the hereditary constitution of the man or woman than by external
happenings: or they may be mainly or at least largely determined by the
accidents of the environment during the period before maturity. One
of the most potent factors in the environment will be the attitude of
the parents towards sexual matters. On the one hand they may adopt the
common, horror-stricken attitude towards sex, hushing it up, making
it clear to the sensitive mind of childhood that there is something
thoroughly bad about it, and so laying the best possible foundations
for future repression. Or, on the other hand, they may openly adopt
the psycho-analytic view as to the rôle of sex in the development of
mind, may further believe that the fullest analysis and self-knowledge
is always desirable, and may accordingly be pointing out to the
child interpretations of its actions and sayings in terms of sex,
familiarizing it with sex from the outset, not merely not discouraging
but actually encouraging reference to sexual matters. This will tend,
_ceteris paribus_, to the development of a mind in which many of the
more complex mental operations will not usually persist because the
subject will be continually unbuilding them into their constituent
parts, of which sex will be the most unvarying and important.

Both these types are to my judgment obviously unsatisfactory. The ideal
organization of the mind must be one in which first there is a minimum
of waste of energy, secondly a maximum realization of potentiality.
The operations of mind may further be thought of from two different
angles--a subserving the biological needs of the organism, or as
ends in themselves. From the first point of view, thought is action
_in posse_: efficiency and full utilization of energy are here the
requirements, and it is obvious that any method which even partially
separates one part of the mental organization from the rest must be a
poor one, that a refusal to face any portion of reality, such as, in
our special case, the physical side of sex, must put the organism at a
disadvantage in a world in which that portion of reality plays, as it
obviously does, an important rôle.

The correct type of organization is one of the type which has been
developed over and over again in the course of evolution, for
different functions: it is the hierarchical one, in which some parts
are dominant, others subordinate, the dominant parts helpless without
the subordinate, the subordinate different, through the fact of their
subordination, from what they would otherwise have been, doing most of
the hard work, but under the guidance of the dominant. Only in this way
is a unitary organization arrived at in which there is the minimum of
waste, of antagonism between the parts.

The psycho-analysts have, by analysing the pathology of mind, shown
us how waste of energy may arise in particular cases, and so make it
easier for us to avoid it in general.

One may recognize the merits of Freud as an investigator without
accepting all or even the majority of his conclusions. As the late
W. H. Rivers pointed out, Freud will always be remembered in the
history of psychology because he introduced new ideas and new methods
into the science. Previous workers had discovered the realm of the
subconscious; but they had not discovered the real nature of its
relation to the rest of the mental organization. Freud pointed out
that there was often a biological value attached to the power of
forgetting as well as to that of remembering, and that in any case
in most of us a large amount of experience is rendered unconscious by
suppression, or an attempt made to force it into the unconscious by
repression. He and his followers and other schools of psychologists
have pointed out the importance of unresolved conflicts in determining
thought and behaviour, and have made it clear that in the ordinary
civilized community of to-day a large proportion of those conflicts
arise out of difficulties connected with the sex-instinct. And, even
if we reject the extreme claims made by many Freudians, we must admit
that psycho-analysis has shown that many cases of actual perversion
of instinct may be cured by analytic methods, and that sex occupies a
very much larger space in the mind than was previously supposed. It
had not been previously supposed, because of the fact that it tends to
appear in consciousness in disguised form--either sublimated and thus
intertwined with other emotions and instincts or with unusual objects,
or else rationalized as something else, or kept below the surface of
consciousness as an unfulfilled wish; and because there is a resistance
in most of us to recognizing its importance.

This revolution in our thought has proved very unpalatable to many. In
just the same way as a large proportion of Darwin’s opponents opposed
him because they believed that to accept man’s simian origin was a
repulsive degradation, so many of the opponents of psycho-analysis
oppose it because they believe that to ascribe this huge rôle to sex
in the genesis of our psyche is a repulsive degradation.

To my mind there are two very general questions which the student of
human sex psychology now has to face, if he takes not necessarily
the whole but the central theses of psycho-analysis, however much
pruned, as proven. The first is this: granted that sex does play such
a large part, especially in early years, in the genesis of our mental
organization, is it desirable that the average adult or adolescent
should, by analysis, be given full self-knowledge on the subject?

The second is this: granted that sex does penetrate into more corners
of mind in man than in lower organisms, is this really a regrettable
thing, or can we find any grounds for believing it to be desirable or
biologically progressive?

To answer this we shall have to go back a little to first principles,
and consider, however briefly, certain facts as to the march of
evolution.

Evolution is essentially progressive. It proceeds on the whole in
a certain direction, and that direction is on the whole towards a
realization of what seems to us to have positive value. The direction,
however, as a matter of fact, is most striking when we consider the
maximum level attained, much less so when we consider the average, not
at all when we look at the minimum.

The method or mechanism of progress may differ in different types,
and it does differ in man from that which is found in other mammals.
In most higher animals progress is brought about chiefly by natural
selection operating upon individuals, although in a few forms selection
operates chiefly upon groups of communities: in both cases the changes
in the inherited constitution of the species are the important
changes. In man, however, in all except the very early stages of
his development, changes in inherited constitution have been small
and unimportant, and the chief changes of evolutionary significance
have been those in tradition; selection among individuals has been
of relatively little importance, and selection has fallen mainly
upon groups and, to an ever-increasing extent, upon their ideas and
traditions.

In spite of differences in method as between different types of
organism, the tendency has been in the same direction--towards
a possibility of greater control, greater independence, greater
complexity, and greater regulation or harmony.

Looked at from the evolutionary point of view, the moving, dynamic
point of view, we have to think of human sex-psychology in yet another
way. So far we have been treating it as what it is; now we must think
of what it may become.

The general rule in evolution--the natural and obvious rule--is that
acquisitions are not thrown away when change occurs, but built upon,
utilized for some new function. The endostyle of the lowest chordates,
part of a very primitive type of feeding mechanism, was converted,
when they changed their mode of life, into the thyroid gland: the
parathyroids develop from the remains of the gill-apparatus when
gills are discarded for lungs: the secondary sexual differences which
originate as accidental consequence of the primary difference between
the sexes are, over and over again, elaborated into special characters
employed in courtship.

So the sex-instinct and its associated emotion, at first simply one
among a number of separate and scarcely-correlated instincts, has in
man become the basis for numerous new mental functions. It can enter
into the composition of various emotions, though its character is often
disguised and its presence often undetected. It contributes to some of
the most exalted states of mind which we can experience. The sexual
relationship, which in lower animals involves neither contact nor even
propinquity, but simply simultaneous discharge of reproductive cells,
and in most animals is a purely temporary affair, is very different
in man. Even in those birds and non-human mammals in which the sexes
remain associated for long periods or permanently, the different
departments of life are more in water-tight compartments, the psychical
activity is subordinate to the physiological: in man the physiological
side, though of course still basic and necessary, is more--and can
be much more--subordinate to the psychological, and all parts of the
mental life interpenetrate to a much greater extent; so that the
sex-instinct may become transformed by a psychological process roughly
analogous to the transformation of physical energy, and reappear in
altered guise in various other activities of mind.

If we look at the matter broadly, we see that man is in a period of
evolutionary transition as regards sex. We found previously that the
greatest change connected with sex which has been made in the evolution
of higher animals was the change by which there was evolved a brain
and mind with associated sense-organs in which accurate perception of
objects at a distance could occur, a mechanism which really dominated
the working of the organism as a whole, and in which memory and emotion
seemed to play an important part. Once this happened, the sex-instinct
could be linked up with general emotional reactions and connected with
external objects capable of inducing emotion.

What was the result? That in every group possessing such a type of
mind, epigamic characters of a beautiful or striking or bizarre
nature were evolved. This first linking-up of sex with mind produced,
eventually, a large proportion of the beauty of the organic world. It
coloured and adorned not only many a bird, but even newts and fish
and spiders; it helped elicit song and music from mere sounds and
noises; it moulded our own bodies, coloured our lips and eyes, and
everywhere helped in adding grace to mere serviceableness; it saw to it
that, as St. Paul puts it, “even our uncomely parts have an abundant
comeliness.” But, as we have just pointed out, its connection with the
mind’s higher centres was in all pre-human forms still temporary, under
the control of cyclical physiological changes, and the mind as a whole
was still constructed in compartments, so that different instincts
and different experiences did not necessarily or even usually come in
contact with each other.

The next great change is being made now; it concerns a further
development of mind and a consequent fresh mode of connection of sex
with mental life. As we have outlined above, this change in mind
consists in the tendency towards uniting the different parts of the
psyche, both those portions given by heredity and the modification due
to experience, into a single organic whole, and in making this whole
more dominant over the other aspects of the organism; the consequent
tendency as regards the relationship of sex to the organism is towards
taking it out of its single groove, its water-tight compartment, and
bringing it into more complete and more permanent union with the rest
of the mind. Furthermore, the main change and the consequent change as
regards sex are both of a biologically progressive nature.

We are now, I think, owing to our taking this broad biological view,
in a better position to make up our minds as to some at least of the
difficulties which beset us to-day in any attempt to deal squarely
with the relation of sex to human life. It is true that some of
these difficulties are permanent. The synthesis of a unitary and
comprehensive mental organization can never be an easy task. The
child is endowed with a number of instinctive tendencies which, as
in animals, each tend whenever aroused to occupy the whole mental
field to the exclusion of all others, producing divergence and lack
of co-ordination instead of unity and organization. Then again, the
experience of any one individual may be highly unusual. For the child
to co-ordinate his various tendencies with each other and with his
own experience and with the tradition and experience of the race must
always be difficult, and there will always be some failures.

There is another permanent difficulty, a biological disharmony, in the
fact that sexual maturity in man comes several years before general
maturity, and that again, at least in any state of civilization which
we can at present imagine as practicable, several years before the
economic possibility of marriage. There will always be crises of
adolescence; there will always be suffering and difficulty due to this
disharmony in time between the origin of the full sexual instinct and
the possibility of its proper satisfaction.

However, granted these permanent difficulties, there are others which
may be reduced or made to disappear. Granted that we have to organize
our minds into a whole, we can see the general plan on which we
should aim at organizing it. We must aim first at having no barriers
between different parts of the mind. Every attempt must be made in
the education of children to prevent there being a stigma attached
to one whole section of mental life, and so to avoid its partial or
total dissociation from the rest. On the other hand, the absence of
barriers does not imply the absence of any relation of subordination or
dominance of one part to another. One of the most important biological
generalizations is that progressive evolution is accompanied by the
rise of one part to dominance and, whenever there are many parts to be
considered, by the arrangement of the rest in some form of hierarchy,
each part being subordinate to one above, dominant to one below. It
is such a hierarchy which we must try to construct in our mental
organization.

It is obviously impossible here to go into the whole question of
values and ideals, but it is clear to any one who has given the
briefest reflection to the subject that there are certain values,
æsthetic, intellectual, and moral, which are ultimate for the mind of
man, certain ideals--of truth and honesty, intellectual satisfaction,
righteousness or at least freedom from the sense of sin or guilt,
completeness and self-realization, unselfishness and serviceableness
and so forth--which (though perhaps in varying proportions) are by
common consent accepted as the highest: and further that the greater
the attempt to deepen and broaden these, to increase their mental
intensity and to widen their range and association, the more they
tend to emerge into something increasingly unitary, in which it is
seen that honesty is also beautiful and useful, that intellectual
satisfaction is in the long run serviceable to the community, that
unselfishness to be effective requires thought and will besides mere
altruistic emotion, that one of the greatest aids to any genuine
righteousness is an æsthetic love of beautiful things that prevents our
doing ugly things, and so _ad infinitum_.

The proper way, then, to build the sex instinct into the mental system
is not to have its stimulation cause a merely physiological and
uninhibited desire for its gratification, nor to bring about a forcible
repression and an attempt to break connection between it and the other
parts of the mind.

The desirable method is to have free connection between it and the
dominant ideas, so that its stimulation brings about a stimulation of
them too. This leads, as a matter of experience, to the incorporation
of the sexual emotion in the dominant ideas, or we had better say an
interpenetration of one with the other, so that the sexual emotion is
no longer simply sexual emotion, but is become part of something very
much larger and very much better. Let the great writers say in their
few words what I should say much worse in many.

Wordsworth’s “sense sublime of something far more deeply interfused”
opens a window on to the general process of sublimation: and Blake’s
description of the physical union of the sexes as “that ... on which
the soul expands her wing” is an epitome of a particular aspect of
our particular problem. Or again, when St. Paul says “Am I not free?”
or “All things are lawful unto me,” he means that by subordinating all
sides of himself to his highest ideals, he has reached that state in
which what he does is right to him because he only wants to do what
is right. (True that, as he himself confesses, he is not always able
to keep in that state: but when he is in it, he attains that complete
freedom which is the subordination of lower to higher desire.)

Physiologically speaking, the activation of the sex instinct, when the
connection is made in this way, arouses the higher centres, and these
react upon the centres connected with the sex instinct, modifying their
mode of action. The nett result is thus that both act simultaneously
to produce a single whole of a new type. Processes of this nature
are common in the nervous system, as has been shown for instance by
Hughlings Jackson, Head, and Rivers.[39]

Thus the higher, dominant parts of the mind are strengthened by their
connection with such lower parts as the simple sex instinct, and the
sex instinct is able to play a rôle in any operation of the mind,
however exalted, in which emotion is in any way concerned. Rivers
believes that the actual conflict between controlled and controlling
parts of the mind is a potent generator of mental “energy”; and adds,
“whatever be the source of the energy, however, we can be confident
that by the process of sublimation the lives upon which it is expended
take a special course, and in such case it is not easy to place any
limit to its activity. We do not know how high the goal that it may
reach.”[40]

The change is thus on the one side from the relative independence of
the sex instinct towards its subordination to a position in a hierarchy
of mental process, but on the other from a rigid limitation of its
scope towards a greater universality by establishing connections with
all other parts of the mind. Further, there is also a change towards
greater dominance and “self-determination” of the mental as against the
physical.

A great many of the difficulties which beset us, both as individuals
and as communities, come from the fact that both these changes are only
in process of being made, and are (even approximately) complete only in
a very small number of persons.

Lack of restraint is failure to construct a properly-working hierarchy.
That is a very simple example. Less easy to analyse but equally
vicious, are the innumerable cases in which some sort of equilibrium
is only attained not by a free interaction of dominant and subordinate
parts, but by repression. Conflicts arise, which persist, either in an
open form or in the subterranean regions of the unconscious. In either
case they tend to be projected by the subject into his ideas of other
people. This projection, or interpretation of external reality in terms
of one’s self, is a curious and almost universal attribute of the
human mind. The most familiar example is perhaps the anthropomorphism
which in religion after religion has invested the powers of the
universe with human form, human mental process, human personality--or
at least with form, mind, and personality similar to those of man;
while a very simple case is that in which certain neurotic types
project their depression so as to colour everything that comes into
their cognizance a gloomy black.

In the sphere of sex this process is, alas, most potently at work. The
man in whom the sexual instinct still lives a more or less independent,
uninhibited life of its own, tends--unless he has special evidence to
the contrary, and often even then--to interpret the behaviour and the
minds of others in the terms familiar to himself, and to suppose that
they too must be stopped by the fear of punishment or of loss of caste
if they are not to commit excesses.

On the other hand, those in whom there is a constant conflict with a
sexual origin project it here, there, and everywhere into the breasts
of those they know, and interpret others’ motives in terms of their own
repressed wishes.

Furthermore, most of our existing laws and customs are based on a
state of society in which the changes to which we have referred had
not progressed as far as they have to-day, and man’s psychology was a
little less removed from that of other mammals.

The result is that those who attempt the complete emancipation
possible to a properly-organized mind are confronted first by the lag
of our institutions and traditions, and secondly by the unconcealed
suspicion of all those--and they are as yet the large majority--in
which the conflicts arising out of sex are unresolved. It is from the
sum of those conflicts that the spirit prevalent with regard to sex
to-day derives its character--shocked and shamefaced as regards one’s
own sexual life, vindictive and grudging as regards the difficulties
of others. The bulk of men and women cannot treat sexual problems in a
scientific spirit, because of the store of bottled-up emotion in the
wrong place that they have laid up for themselves by their failure to
come to proper terms with their sexual instincts. The soul should grow
to deserve the words Crashaw wrote of St. Theresa--“O thou undaunted
daughter of desires!” But this the soul of such disharmonic beings can
never do.

This brings us to our other pressing question. Should the results
of psycho-analytic methods, the knowledge that the sex instinct is
fundamental and is interwoven into the roots of the highest spiritual
activities--should the inculcation and demonstration of this be part
of education? Some would say yes, and would argue that to know oneself
is essential to a proper realization of one’s capacities. Personally I
am extremely doubtful of the correctness of this answer. Knowledge of
the processes of digestion is not necessary to digest well--so long as
we go on digesting well: it is only necessary when we digest badly. In
that case the processes involved are automatic: but even in processes
which require a great deal of learning, we find a similar state of
affairs. A man can become expert at, say, a game requiring the most
delicate adjustments of hand and eye without analysing the processes
he employs, but by practising them as finished articles, so to speak;
and it is equally obvious that Shakespeare and Shelley and Blake and
other great writers produced their works without the least analytical
knowledge of the obscure and rather unpleasant processes which, if we
are to believe the critics who psycho-analyse dead authors in the pages
of Freudian journals, were “really” at work below the surface. Analysis
constitutes a serious surgical operation for the mind, and, as one of
the leading Austrian psycho-analysts has recently said, we do not want
to perform this operation on healthy people any more than we want to
open their abdomens merely for the sake of seeing that their viscera
are normal.

If matters concerning sex are treated properly during a child’s
development and education, the necessity for psycho-analysis and any
extension of analytic knowledge of the foundations of one’s own mind
that it may bring is done away with. If it can be ensured that there
is no obvious avoidance of the subject leading to repression in the
child’s mind, and on the other hand no undue prominence given to it so
that a morbid curiosity is aroused, a large proportion of the conflicts
that now arise could be avoided. The other necessity is that there
should be provision for sublimation--in art or music, in social service
or in one’s own work, in religion, or, in modified form, in sport or
romance.

It is perfectly possible, in such case, for mental development to
proceed naturally and comparatively smoothly towards a unified
organization of the type of which we have spoken. Psycho-analysis
would not help a boy or girl developing in such a way, any more than
would a study of all the characters we have inherited from our simian
forefathers help us to realize our specifically human possibilities. On
the other hand, when the intellectual desire to know things for their
own sake is aroused, as it is in most boys and girls between the ages
of about fourteen and twenty, then just as it is good, in order to
get a true picture of the universe, for them to know and be presented
with the evidence for man’s evolution from lower forms, so it is good
for the same reason to give them an account of their psychological
organization, including evidence for the rôle which sex plays in the
genesis of higher mental activities--without, however, any necessity
for psychological experiments in burrowing into their own foundations.
In this case such knowledge would have the additional value of putting
them on their guard against allowing themselves to be prejudiced by
their own incompletely-adjusted conflicts.

We are all of us too prone to think that a phenomenon is somehow
“explained,” or interpreted better, by analysing it into its component
parts or discovering its origin than by studying it in and for itself.

The new type of mental organization acquired by man permits of wholly
new types of mental process, of a complexity as far exceeding those
that we deduce in brutes as does the physical organism of a dog or an
ant that of a polyp or a protozoan: and it is part of our business to
realize those possibilities to the fullest extent.

To sum up, then, biological investigation in the first place shows
us how certain abnormalities of sexual psychology may be more easily
interpreted as caused by comparatively simple physical abnormalities
than by the more complex distortions of psychological origin dealt
with by psycho-analysis. In the second place, by giving us a broader
_aperçu_ than can otherwise be gained over the evolution of sex
and the direction visible in biological history, it clears up to a
certain extent some of the difficulties which the discoveries of the
psycho-analytic school have rendered acute.

If the changes in the relation of the sex instinct to the rest of the
mind, which I have spoken of above as being in operation at present,
should one day progress so far as to be more or less carried through
in a majority, or in a dominant section of the population, the whole
outlook of society towards the sex problem would be changed, and
the laws and institutions and customs connected with it completely
remodelled.

The most pressing task of those who are thinking over the problem of
sex in human life will often be the relief of suffering and the removal
of abuses: but the broader view should never be forgotten, and every
attempt should be made to think constructively with a view to realizing
the enormous possibilities that such a change would bring about.
