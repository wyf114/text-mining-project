  "Sketches indeed, from that most passionate page,
  A woman's heart, of feelings, thoughts, that make
  The atmosphere in which her spirit moves;
  But like all other earthly elements,
  O'ercast with clouds; now dark, now touched with light,
  With rainbows, sunshine, showers, moonlight, stars,
  Chasing each other's change. I fain would trace
  Its brightness and its blackness."
