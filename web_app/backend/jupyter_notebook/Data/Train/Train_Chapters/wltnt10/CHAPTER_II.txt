CHAPTER II.

OF THE PRINCIPLE WHICH GIVES OCCASION TO
THE DIVISION OF LABOUR.

This division of labour, from which so many advantages are derived, is not
originally the effect of any human wisdom, which foresees and intends that
general opulence to which it gives occasion. It is the necessary, though
very slow and gradual, consequence of a certain propensity in human nature,
which has in view no such extensive utility ; the propensity to truck,
barter, and exchange one thing for another.

Whether this propensity be one of those original principles in human nature,
of which no further account can be given, or whether, as seems more
probable, it be the necessary consequence of the faculties of reason and
speech, it belongs not to our present subject to inquire. It is common to
all men, and to be found in no other race of animals, which seem to know
neither this nor any other species of contracts. Two greyhounds, in running
down the same hare, have sometimes the appearance of acting in some sort of
concert. Each turns her towards his companion, or endeavours to intercept
her when his companion turns her towards himself. This, however, is not the
effect of any contract, but of the accidental concurrence of their passions
in the same object at that particular time. Nobody ever saw a dog make a
fair and deliberate exchange of one bone for another with another dog.
Nobody ever saw one animal, by its gestures and natural cries signify to
another, this is mine, that yours ; I am willing to give this for that. When
an animal wants to obtain something either of a man, or of another animal,
it has no other means of persuasion, but to gain the favour of those whose
service it requires. A puppy fawns upon its dam, and a spaniel endeavours,
by a thousand attractions, to engage the attention of its master who is at
dinner, when it wants to be fed by him. Man sometimes uses the same arts
with his brethren, and when he has no other means of engaging them to act
according to his inclinations, endeavours by every servile and fawning
attention to obtain their good will. He has not time, however, to do this
upon every occasion. In civilized society he stands at all times in need of
the co-operation and assistance of great multitudes, while his whole life is
scarce sufficient to gain the friendship of a few persons. In almost every
other race of animals, each individual, when it is grown up to maturity, is
entirely independent, and in its natural state has occasion for the
assistance of no other living creature. But man has almost constant
occasion for the help of his brethren, and it is in vain for him to expect
it from their benevolence only. He will be more likely to prevail if he can
interest their self-love in his favour, and shew them that it is for their
own advantage to do for him what he requires of them. Whoever offers to
another a bargain of any kind, proposes to do this. Give me that which I
want, and you shall have this which you want, is the meaning of every such
offer; and it is in this manner that we obtain from one another the far
greater part of those good offices which we stand in need of. It is not from
the benevolence of the butcher the brewer, or the baker that we expect our
dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves,
not to their humanity, but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our
own necessities, but of their advantages. Nobody but a beggar chooses to
depend chiefly upon the benevolence of his fellow-citizens. Even a beggar
does not depend upon it entirely. The charity of well-disposed people,
indeed, supplies him with the whole fund of his subsistence.     But though
this principle ultimately provides him with all the necessaries of life
which he has occasion for, it neither does nor can provide him with them as
he has occasion for them. The greater part of his occasional wants are
supplied in the same manner as those of other people, by treaty, by barter,
and by purchase. With the money which one man gives him he purchases food.
The old clothes which another bestows upon him he exchanges for other
clothes which suit him better, or for lodging, or for food, or for money,
with which he can buy either food, clothes, or lodging, as he has occasion.

As it is by treaty, by barter, and by purchase, that we obtain from one
another the greater part of those mutual good offices which we stand in need
of, so it is this same trucking disposition which originally gives occasion
to the division of labour. In a tribe of hunters or shepherds, a particular
person makes bows and arrows, for example, with more readiness and dexterity
than any other. He frequently exchanges them for cattle or for venison, with
his companions; and he finds at last that he can, in this manner, get more
cattle and venison, than if he himself went to the field to catch them. From
a regard to his own interest, therefore, the making of bows and arrows grows
to be his chief business, and he becomes a sort of armourer. Another excels
in making the frames and covers of their little huts or moveable houses. He
is accustomed to be of use in this way to his neighbours, who reward him in
the same manner with cattle and with venison, till at last he finds it his
interest to dedicate himself entirely to this employment, and to become a
sort of house-carpenter. In the same manner a third becomes a smith or a
brazier; a fourth, a tanner or dresser of hides or skins, the principal part
of the clothing of savages. And thus the certainty of being able to exchange
all that surplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and
above his own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men's
labour as he may have occasion for, encourages every man to apply himself to
a particular occupation, and to cultivate and bring to perfection whatever
talent of genius he may possess for that particular species of business.

The difference of natural talents in different men, is, in reality, much less
than we are aware of ; and the very different genius which appears to
distinguish men of different professions, when grown up to maturity, is not
upon many occasions so much the cause, as the effect of the division of
labour. The difference between the most dissimilar characters, between a
philosopher and a common street porter, for example, seems to arise not so
much from nature, as from habit, custom, and education. When they came in to
the world, and for the first six or eight years of their existence, they
were, perhaps, very much alike, and neither their parents nor play-fellows
could perceive any remarkable difference. About that age, or soon after,
they come to be employed in very different occupations. The difference of
talents comes then to be taken notice of, and widens by degrees, till at
last the vanity of the philosopher is willing to acknowledge scarce any
resemblance. But without the disposition to truck, barter, and exchange,
every man must have procured to himself every necessary and conveniency of
life which he wanted. All must have had the same duties to perform, and the
same work to do, and there could have been no such difference of employment
as could alone give occasion to any great difference of talents.

As it is this disposition which forms that difference of talents, so
remarkable among men of different professions, so it is this same
disposition which renders that difference useful. Many tribes of animals,
acknowledged to be all of the same species, derive from nature a much more
remarkable distinction of genius, than what, antecedent to custom and
education, appears to take place among men. By nature a philosopher is not
in genius and disposition half so different from a street porter, as a
mastiff is from a grey-hound, or a grey-hound from a spaniel, or this last
from a shepherd's dog. Those different tribes of animals, however, though
all of the same species are of scarce any use to one another. The strength
of the mastiff is not in the least supported either by the swiftness of the
greyhound, or by the sagacity of the spaniel, or by the docility of the
shepherd's dog. The effects of those different geniuses and talents, for
want of the power or disposition to barter and exchange, cannot be brought
into a common stock, and do not in the least contribute to the better
accommodation and conveniency of the species. Each animal is still obliged
to support and defend itself, separately and independently, and derives no
sort of advantage from that variety of talents with which nature has
distinguished its fellows. Among men, on the contrary, the most dissimilar
geniuses are of use to one another ; the different produces of their
respective talents, by the general disposition to truck, barter, and
exchange, being brought, as it were, into a common stock, where every man
may purchase whatever part of the produce of other men's talents he has
occasion for,




CHAPTER       III.

THAT THE DIVISION OF LABOUR IS LIMITED BY THE EXTENT OF THE MARKET.

As it is the power of exchanging that gives occasion to the division of labour, so the extent of
this division must always be limited by the extent of that power, or, in other words, by the
extent of the market. When the market is very small, no person can have any encouragement
to dedicate himself entirely to one employment, for want of the power to exchange all that
surplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his own consumption,
for such parts of the produce of other men's labour as he has occasion for.

There are some sorts of industry, even of the lowest kind, which can be carried on nowhere
but in a great town. A porter, for example, can find employment and subsistence in no other
place. A village is by much too narrow a sphere for him; even an ordinary market-town is
scarce large enough to afford him constant occupation. In the lone houses and very small
villages which are scattered about in so desert a country as the highlands of Scotland, every
farmer must be butcher, baker, and brewer, for his own family. In such situations we can
scarce expect to find even a smith, a carpenter, or a mason, within less than twenty miles of
another of the same trade. The scattered families that live at eight or ten miles distance from
the nearest of them, must learn to perform themselves a great number of little pieces of work,
for which, in more populous countries, they would call in the assistance of those workmen.
Country workmen are almost everywhere obliged to apply themselves to all the different
branches of industry that have so much affinity to one another as to be employed about the
same sort of materials. A country carpenter deals in every sort of work that is made of wood ;
a country smith in every sort of work that is made of iron. The former is not only a carpenter,
but a joiner, a cabinet-maker, and even a carver in wood, as well as a wheel-wright, a
plough-wright, a cart and waggon-maker. The employments of the latter are still more
various. It is impossible there should be such a trade as even that of a nailer in the remote and
inland parts of the highlands of Scotland. Such a workman at the rate of a thousand nails
a-day, and three hundred working days in the year, will make three hundred thousand nails in
the year. But in such a situation it would be impossible to dispose of one thousand, that is, of
one day's work in the year. As by means of water-carriage, a more extensive market is opened
to every sort of industry than what land-carriage alone can afford it, so it is upon the sea-coast,
and along the banks of navigable rivers, that industry of every kind naturally begins to
subdivide and improve itself, and it is frequently not till a long time after that those
improvements extend themselves to the inland parts of the country. A broad-wheeled waggon,
attended by two men, and drawn by eight horses, in about six weeks time, carries and brings
back between London and Edinburgh near four ton weight of goods. In about the same time a
ship navigated by six or eight men, and sailing between the ports of London and Leith,
frequently carries and brings back two hundred ton weight of goods. Six or eight men,
therefore, by the help of water-carriage, can carry and bring back, in the same time, the same
quantity of goods between London and Edinburgh as fifty broad-wheeled waggons, attended
by a hundred men, and drawn by four hundred horses. Upon two hundred tons of goods,
therefore, carried by the cheapest land-carriage from London to Edinburgh, there must be
charged the maintenance of a hundred men for three weeks, and both the maintenance and
what is nearly equal to maintenance the wear and tear of four hundred horses, as well as of
fifty great waggons. Whereas, upon the same quantity of goods carried by water, there is to be
charged only the maintenance of six or eight men, and the wear and tear of a ship of two
hundred tons burthen, together with the value of the superior risk, or the difference of the
insurance between land and water-carriage. Were there no other communication between
those two places, therefore, but by land-carriage, as no goods could be transported from the
one to the other, except such whose price was very considerable in proportion to their weight,
they could carry on but a small part of that commerce which at present subsists between them,
and consequently could give but a small part of that encouragement which they at present
mutually afford to each other's industry. There could be little or no commerce of any kind
between the distant parts of the world. What goods could bear the expense of land-carriage
between London and Calcutta ? Or if there were any so precious as to be able to support this
expense, with what safety could they be transported through the territories of so many
barbarous nations? Those two cities, however, at present carry on a very considerable
commerce with each other, and by mutually affording a market, give a good deal of
encouragement to each other's industry.

Since such, therefore, are the advantages of water-carriage, it is natural that the first
improvements of art and industry should be made where this conveniency opens the whole
world for a market to the produce of every sort of labour, and that they should always be
much later in extending themselves into the inland parts of the country. The inland parts of the
country can for a long time have no other market for the greater part of their goods, but the
country which lies round about them, and separates them from the sea-coast, and the great
navigable rivers. The extent of the market, therefore, must for a long time be in proportion to
the riches and populousness of that country, and consequently their improvement must always
be posterior to the improvement of that country. In our North American colonies, the
plantations have constantly followed either the sea-coast or the banks of the navigable rivers,
and have scarce anywhere extended themselves to any considerable distance from both.

The nations that, according to the best authenticated history, appear to have been first
civilized, were those that dwelt round the coast of the Mediterranean sea. That sea, by far the
greatest inlet that is known in the world, having no tides, nor consequently any waves, except
such as are caused by the wind only, was, by the smoothness of its surface, as well as by the
multitude of its islands, and the proximity of its neighbouring shores, extremely favourable to
the infant navigation of the world; when, from their ignorance of the compass, men were
afraid to quit the view of the coast, and from the imperfection of the art of ship-building, to
abandon themselves to the boisterous waves of the ocean. To pass beyond the pillars of
Hercules, that is, to sail out of the straits of Gibraltar, was, in the ancient world, long
considered as a most wonderful and dangerous exploit of navigation. It was late before even
the Phoenicians and Carthaginians, the most skilful navigators and ship-builders of those old
times, attempted it; and they were, for a long time, the only nations that did attempt it.

Of all the countries on the coast of the Mediterranean sea, Egypt seems to have been the first
in which either agriculture or manufactures were cultivated and improved to any considerable
degree. Upper Egypt extends itself nowhere above a few miles from the Nile; and in Lower
Egypt, that great river breaks itself into many different canals, which, with the assistance of a
little art, seem to have afforded a communication by water-carriage, not only between all the
great towns, but between all the considerable villages, and even to many farm-houses in the
country, nearly in the same manner as the Rhine and the Maese do in Holland at present. The
extent and easiness of this inland navigation was probably one of the principal causes of the
early improvement of Egypt.

The improvements in agriculture and manufactures seem likewise to have been of very great
antiquity in the provinces of Bengal, in the East Indies, and in some of the eastern provinces
of China, though the great extent of this antiquity is not authenticated by any histories of
whose authority we, in this part of the world, are well assured. In Bengal, the Ganges, and
several other great rivers, form a great number of navigable canals, in the same manner as the
Nile does in Egypt. In the eastern provinces of China, too, several great rivers form, by their
different branches, a multitude of canals, and, by communicating with one another, afford an
inland navigation much more extensive than that either of the Nile or the Ganges, or, perhaps,
than both of them put together. It is remarkable, that neither the ancient Egyptians, nor the
Indians, nor the Chinese, encouraged foreign commerce, but seem all to have derived their
great opulence from this inland navigation.

All the inland parts of Africa, and all that part of Asia which lies any considerable way north
of the Euxine and Caspian seas, the ancient Scythia, the modern Tartary and Siberia, seem, in
all ages of the world, to have been in the same barbarous and uncivilized state in which we
find them at present. The sea of Tartary is the frozen ocean, which admits of no navigation ;
and though some of the greatest rivers in the world run through that country, they are at too
great a distance from one another to carry commerce and communication through the greater
part of it. There are in Africa none of those great inlets, such as the Baltic and Adriatic seas in
Europe, the Mediterranean and Euxine seas in both Europe and Asia, and the gulfs of Arabia,
Persia, India, Bengal, and Siam, in Asia, to carry maritime commerce into the interior parts of
that great continent; and the great rivers of Africa are at too great a distance from one another
to give occasion to any considerable inland navigation. The commerce, besides, which any
nation can carry on by means of a river which does not break itself into any great number of
branches or canals, and which runs into another territory before it reaches the sea, can never
be very considerable, because it is always in the power of the nations who possess that other
territory to obstruct the communication between the upper country and the sea. The navigation
of the Danube is of very little use to the different states of Bavaria, Austria. and Hungary, in
comparison of what it would be, if any of them possessed the whole of its course, till it falls
into the Black sea.




CHAPTER    IV.

OF THE ORIGIN AND USE OF MONEY.

When the division of labour has been once thoroughly established, it is but
a very small part of a man's wants which the produce of his own labour can
supply. He supplies the far greater part of them by exchanging that surplus
part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his own
consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men's labour as he has
occasion for. Every man thus lives by exchanging, or becomes, in some
measure, a merchant, and the society itself grows to be what is properly a
commercial society.

But when the division of labour first began to take place, this power of
exchanging must frequently have been very much clogged and embarrassed in
its operations. One man, we shall suppose, has more of a certain commodity
than he himself has occasion for, while another has less. The former,
consequently, would be glad to dispose of; and the latter to purchase, a
part of this superfluity. But if this latter should chance to have nothing
that the former stands in need of, no exchange can be made between them. The
butcher has more meat in his shop than he himself can consume, and the
brewer and the baker would each of them be willing to purchase a part of it.
But they have nothing to offer in exchange, except the different productions
of their respective trades, and the butcher is already provided with all the
bread and beer which he has immediate occasion for. No exchange can, in this
case, be made between them. He cannot be their merchant, nor they his
customers ; and they are all of them thus mutually less serviceable to one
another. In order to avoid the inconveniency of such situations, every
prudent man in every period of society, after the first establishment of the
division of labour, must naturally have endeavoured to manage his affairs in
such a manner, as to have at all times by him, besides the peculiar produce
of his own industry, a certain quantity of some one commodity or other, such
as he imagined few people would be likely to refuse in exchange for the
produce of their industry. Many different commodities, it is probable, were
successively both thought of and employed for this purpose. In the rude ages
of society, cattle are said to have been the common instrument of commerce ;
and, though they must have been a most inconvenient one, yet, in old times,
we find things were frequently valued according to the number of cattle
which had been given in exchange for them. The armour of Diomede, says
Homer, cost only nine oxen; but that of Glaucus cost a hundred oxen. Salt is
said to be the common instrument of commerce and exchanges in Abyssinia ; a
species of shells in some parts of the coast of India ; dried cod at
Newfoundland; tobacco in Virginia; sugar in some of our West India colonies;
hides or dressed leather in some other countries; and there is at this day a
village In Scotland, where it is not uncommon, I am told, for a workman to
carry nails instead of money to the baker's shop or the ale-house.

In all countries, however, men seem at last to have been determined by
irresistible reasons to give the preference, for this employment, to metals
above every other commodity. Metals can not only be kept with as little loss
as any other commodity, scarce any thing being less perishable than they
are, but they can likewise, without any loss, be divided into any number of
parts, as by fusion those parts can easily be re-united again; a quality
which no other equally durable commodities possess, and which, more than any
other quality, renders them fit to be the instruments of commerce and
circulation. The man who wanted to buy salt, for example, and had nothing
but cattle to give in exchange for it, must have been obliged to buy salt to
the value of a whole ox, or a whole sheep, at a time. He could seldom buy
less than this, because what he was to give for it could seldom be divided
without loss; and if he had a mind to buy more, he must, for the same
reasons, have been obliged to buy double or triple the quantity, the value,
to wit, of two or three oxen, or of two or three sheep. If, on the contrary,
instead of sheep or oxen, he had metals to give in exchange for it, he could
easily proportion the quantity of the metal to the precise quantity of the
commodity which he had immediate occasion for.

Different metals have been made use of by different nations for this
purpose. Iron was the common instrument of commerce among the ancient
Spartans, copper among the ancient Romans, and gold and silver  among all
rich and commercial nations.

Those metals seem originally to have been made use of for this purpose in
rude bars, without any stamp or coinage. Thus we are told by Pliny (Plin.
Hist Nat. lib. 33, cap. 3), upon the authority of Timaeus, an ancient
historian, that, till the time of Servius Tullius, the Romans had no coined
money, but made use of unstamped bars of copper, to purchase whatever they
had occasion for. These rude bars, therefore, performed at this time the
function of rnoney.

The use of metals in this rude state was attended with two very considerable
inconveniences ; first, with the trouble of weighing, and secondly, with
that of assaying them. In the precious metals, where a small difference in
the quantity makes a great difference in the value, even the business of
weighing, with proper exactness, requires at least very accurate weights and
scales. The weighing of gold, in particular, is an operation of some nicety
In the coarser metals, indeed, where a small error would be of little
consequence, less accuracy would, no doubt, be necessary. Yet we should find
it excessively troublesome if every time a poor man had occasion either to
buy or sell a farthing's worth of goods, he was obliged to weigh the
farthing. The operation of assaying is still more difficult, still more
tedious ; and, unless a part of the metal is fairly melted in the crucible,
with proper dissolvents, any conclusion that can be drawn from it is
extremely uncertain. Before the institution of coined money, however, unless
they went through this tedious and difficult operation, people must always
have been liable to the grossest frauds and impositions; and instead of a
pound weight of pure silver, or pure copper, might receive, in exchange for
their goods, an adulterated composition of the coarsest and cheapest
materials, which had, however, in their outward appearance, been made to
resemble those metals. To prevent such abuses, to facilitate exchanges, and
thereby to encourage all sorts of industry and commerce, it has been found
necessary, in all countries that have made any considerable advances towards
improvement, to affix a public stamp upon certain quantities of such
particular metals, as were in those countries commonly made use of to
purchase goods. Hence the origin of coined money, and of those public
offices called mints; institutions exactly of the same nature with those of
the aulnagers and stamp-masters of woollen and linen cloth. All of them are
equally meant to ascertain, by means of a public stamp, the quantity and
uniform goodness of those different commodities when brought to market.

The first public stamps of this kind that were affixed to the current
metals, seem in many cases to have been intended to ascertain, what it was
both most difficult and most important to ascertain, the goodness or
fineness of the metal, and to have resembled the sterling mark which is at
present affixed to plate and bars of silver, or the Spanish mark which is
sometimes affixed to ingots of gold, and which, being struck only upon one
side of the piece, and not covering the whole surface, ascertains the
fineness, but not the weight of the metal. Abraham weighs to Ephron the four
hundred shekels of silver which he had agreed to pay for the field of
Machpelah. They are said, however, to be the current money of the merchant,
and yet are received by weight, and not by tale, in the same manner as
ingots of gold and bars of silver are at present. The revenues of the
ancient Saxon kings of England are said to have been paid, not in money, but
in kind, that is, in victuals and provisions of all sorts. William the
Conqueror introduced the custom of paying them in money. This money,
however, was for a long time, received at the exchequer, by weight, and not
by tale,

The inconveniency and difficulty of weighing those metals with exactness,
gave occasion to the institution of coins, of which the stamp, covering
entirely both sides of the piece, and sometimes the edges too, was supposed
to ascertain not only the fineness, but the weight of the metal. Such
coins, therefore, were received by tale, as at present, without the trouble
of weighing.

The denominations of those coins seem originally to have expressed the
weight or quantity of metal contained in them. In the time of Servius
Tullius, who first coined money at Rome, the Roman as or pondo contained a
Roman pound of good copper. It was divided, in the same manner as our Troyes
pound, into twelve ounces, each of which contained a real ounce of good
copper. The English pound sterling, in the time of Edward I. contained a
pound, Tower weight, of silver of a known fineness. The Tower pound seems to
have been something more than the Roman pound, and something less than the
Troyes pound. This last was not introduced into the mint of England till the
18th of Henry the VIII. The French livre contained, in the time of
Charlemagne, a pound, Troyes weight, of silver of a known fineness. The fair
of Troyes in Champaign was at that time frequented by all the nations of
Europe, and the weights and measures of so famous a market were generally
known and esteemed. The Scots money pound contained, from the time of
Alexander the First to that of Robert Bruce, a pound of silver of the same
weight and fineness with the English pound sterling. English, French, and
Scots pennies, too, contained all of them originally a real penny-weight of
silver, the twentieth part of an ounce, and the two hundred-and-fortieth
part of a pound. The shilling, too, seems originally to have been
the denomination of a weight. "When wheat is at twelve shillings the quarter,"
says an ancient statute of Henry III." then wastel bread of a farthing shall
weigh eleven shillings and fourpence". The proportion, however, between the
shilling, and either the penny on the one hand, or the pound on the other,
seems not to have been so constant and uniform as that between the penny and
the pound. During the first race of the kings of France, the French sou or
shilling appears upon different occasions to have contained five, twelve,
twenty, and forty pennies. Among the ancient Saxons, a shilling appears at
one time to have contained only five pennies, and it is not improbable that
it may have been as variable among them as among their neighbours, the
ancient Franks. From the time of Charlemagne among the French, and from that
of William the Conqueror among the English, the proportion between the
pound, the shilling, and the penny, seems to have been uniformly the same as
at present, though the value of each has been very different ; for in every
country of the world, I believe, the avarice and injustice of princes and
sovereign states, abusing the confidence of their subjects, have by degrees
diminished the real quantity of metal, which had been originally contained
in their coins. The Roman as, in the latter ages of the republic, was
reduced to the twenty-fourth part of its original value, and, instead of
weighing a pound, came to weigh only half an ounce. The English pound and
penny contain at present about a third only ; the Scots pound and penny
about a thirty-sixth ; and the French pound and penny about a sixty-sixth
part of their original value. By means of those operations, the princes and
sovereign states which performed them were enabled, in appearance, to pay
their debts and fulfil their engagements with a smaller quantity of silver
than would otherwise have been requisite. It was indeed in appearance only ;
for their creditors were really defrauded of a part of what was due to them.
All other debtors in the state were allowed the same privilege, and might
pay with the same nominal sum of the new and debased coin whatever they had
borrowed in the old. Such operations, therefore, have always proved
favourable to the debtor, and ruinous to the creditor, and have sometimes
produced a greater and more universal revolution in the fortunes of private
persons, than could have been occasioned by a very great public calamity.

It is in this manner that money has become, in all civilized nations, the
universal instrument of commerce, by the intervention of which goods of all
kinds are bought and sold, or exchanged for one another.

What are the rules which men naturally observe, in exchanging them either
for money, or for one another, I shall now proceed to examine. These rules
determine what may be called the relative or exchangeable value of goods.

The word VALUE, it is to be observed, has two different meanings, and
sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object, and sometimes the
power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object conveys.
The one may be called ' value in use ;' the other, 'value in exchange.' The
things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no
value in exchange ; and, on the contrary, those which have the greatest
value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use. Nothing is more
useful than water ; but it will purchase scarce any thing; scarce any thing
can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the contrary, has scarce any
value in use; but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently be had
in exchange for it.

In order to investigate the principles which regulate the exchangeable value
of commodities, I shall endeavour to shew,

First, what is the real measure of this exchangeable value; or wherein
consists the real price of all commodities.

Secondly, what are the different parts of which this real price is composed
or made up.

And, lastly, what are the different circumstances which sometimes raise some
or all of these different parts of price above, and sometimes sink them
below, their natural or ordinary rate; or, what are the causes which
sometimes hinder the market price, that is, the actual price of commodities,
from coinciding exactly with what may be called their natural price.

I shall endeavour to explain, as fully and distinctly as I can, those three
subjects in the three following chapters, for which I must very earnestly
entreat both the patience and attention of the reader : his patience, in
order to examine a detail which may, perhaps, in some places, appear
unnecessarily tedious; and his attention, in order to understand what may
perhaps, after the fullest explication which I am capable of giving it,
appear still in some degree obscure. I am always willing to run some hazard
of being tedious, in order to be sure that I am perspicuous; and, after
taking the utmost pains that I can to be perspicuous, some obscurity may
still appear to remain upon a subject, in its own nature extremely
abstracted.






CHAPTER    V.

OF THE REAL AND NOMINAL PRICE OF COMMODITIES, OR OF THEIR PRICE IN
LABOUR, AND THEIR PRICE IN MONEY.

Every man is rich or poor according to the degree in which he can afford to
enjoy the necessaries, conveniencies, and amusements of human life. But
after the division of labour has once thoroughly taken place, it is but a
very small part of these with which a man's own labour can supply him. The
far greater part of them he must derive from the labour of other people, and
he must be rich or poor according to the quantity of that labour which he
can command, or which he can afford to purchase. The value of any commodity,
therefore, to the person who possesses it, and who means not to use or
consume it himself, but to exchange it for other commodities, is equal to
the quantity of labour which it enables him to purchase or command. Labour
therefore, is the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities.

The real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man who
wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it.     What every
thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it and who wants to
dispose of it, or exchange it for something else, is the toil and trouble
which it can save to himself, and which it can impose upon other people.
What is bought with money, or with goods, is purchased by labour, as much as
what we acquire by the toil of our own body. That money, or those goods,
indeed, save us this toil. They contain the value of a certain quantity of
labour, which we exchange for what is supposed at the time to contain the
value of an equal quantity. Labour was the first price, the original
purchase money that was paid for all things. It was not by gold or by silver,
but by labour, that all the wealth of the world was originally purchased;
and its value, to those who possess it, and who want to exchange it for some
new productions, is precisely equal to the quantity of' labour which it can
enable them to purchase or command.

Wealth, as Mr Hobbes says, is power. But the person who either acquires, or
succeeds to a great fortune, does not necessarily acquire or succeed to any
political power, either civil or military. His fortune may, perhaps, afford
him the means of acquiring both; but the mere possession of that fortune
does not necessarily convey to him either. The power which that possession
immediately and directly conveys to him, is the power of purchasing a
certain command over all the labour, or over all the produce of labour which
is then in the market. His fortune is greater or less, precisely in
proportion to the extent of this power, or to the quantity either of other
men's labour, or, what is the same thing, of the produce of other men's
labour, which it enables him to purchase or command. The exchangeable value
of every thing must always be precisely equal to the extent of this power
which it conveys to its owner.

But though labour be the real measure of the exchangeable value of all
commodities, it is not that by which their value is commonly estimated. It
is often difficult to ascertain the proportion between two different
quantities of labour. The time spent in two different sorts of work will not
always alone determine this proportion. The different degrees of hardship
endured, and of ingenuity exercised, must likewise be taken into account.
There may be more labour in an hour's hard work, than in two hours easy
business ; or in an hour's application to a trade which it cost ten years
labour to learn, than in a month's industry, at an ordinary and obvious
employment. But it is not easy to find any accurate measure either of
hardship or ingenuity. In exchanging, indeed, the different productions of
different sorts of labour for one another, some allowance is commonly made
for both. It is adjusted, however, not by any accurate measure, but by the
higgling and bargaining of the market, according to that sort of rough
equality which, though not exact, is sufficient for carrying on the business
of common life.

Every commodity, besides, Is more frequently exchanged for, and thereby
compared with, other commodities, than with labour. It is more natural,
therefore, to estimate its exchangeable value by the quantity of some other
commodity, than by that of the labour which it can produce. The greater part
of people, too, understand better what is meant by a quantity of a
particular commodity, than by a quantity of labour. The one is a plain
palpable object ; the other an abstract notion, which though it can be made
sufficiently intelligible, is not altogether so natural and obvious.

But when barter ceases, and money has become the common instrument of
commerce, every particular commodity is more frequently exchanged for money
than for any other commodity. The butcher seldom carries his beef or his
mutton to the baker or the brewer, in order to exchange them for bread or
for beer ; but he carries them to the market, where he exchanges them for
money, and afterwards exchanges that money for bread and for beer. The
quantity of money which he gets for them regulates, too, the quantity of
bread and beer which he can afterwards purchase. It is more natural and
obvious to him, therefore, to estimate their value by the quantity of money,
the commodity for which he immediately exchanges them, than by that of
bread and beer, the commodities for which he can exchange them only by the
intervention of another commodity ; and rather to say that his butcher's
meat is worth three-pence or fourpence a-pound, than that it is worth three
or four pounds of bread, or three or four quarts of small beer. Hence it
comes to pass, that the exchangeable value of every commodity is more
frequently estimated by the quantity of money, than by the quantity either
of labour or of any other commodity which can be had in exchange for it.

Gold and silver, however, like every other commodity, vary in their value;
are sometimes cheaper and sometimes dearer, sometimes of easier and
sometimes of more difficult purchase. The quantity of labour which any
particular quantity of them can purchase or command, or the quantity of
other goods which it will exchange for, depends always upon the fertility or
barrenness of the mines which happen to be known about the time when such
exchanges are made. The discovery of the abundant mines of America, reduced,
in the sixteenth century, the value of gold and silver in Europe to about a
third of what it had been before. As it cost less labour to bring those
metals from the mine to the market, so, when they were brought thither, they
could purchase or command less labour; and this revolution in their value,
though perhaps the greatest, is by no means the only one of which history
gives some account. But as a measure of quantity, such as the natural foot,
fathom, or handful, which is continually varying in its own quantity, can
never be an accurate measure of the quantity of other things ; so a
commodity which is itself continually varying in its own value, can never be
an accurate measure of the value of other commodities. Equal quantities of
labour, at all times and places, may be said to be of equal value to the
labourer. In his ordinary state of health, strength, and spirits ; in the
ordinary degree of his skill and dexterity, he must always lay down the same
portion of his ease, his liberty, and his happiness. The price which he pays
must always be the same, whatever may be the quantity of goods which he
receives in return for it. Of these, indeed, it may sometimes purchase a
greater and sometimes a smaller quantity ; but it is their value which
varies, not that of the labour which purchases them. At all times and
places, that is dear which it is difficult to come at, or which it costs
much labour to acquire; and that cheap which is to be had easily, or with
very little labour. Labour alone, therefore, never varying in its own value,
is alone the ultimate and real standard by which the value of all
commodities can at all times and places be estimated and compared. It is
their real price; money is their nominal price only.

But though equal quantities of labour are always of equal value to the
labourer, yet to the person who employs him they appear sometimes to be of
greater, and sometimes of smaller value. He purchases them sometimes with a
greater, and sometimes with a smaller quantity of goods, and to him the
price of labour seems to vary like that of all other things. It appears to
him dear in the one case, and cheap in the other. In reality, however, it is
the goods which are cheap in the one case, and dear in the other.

In this popular sense, therefore, labour, like commodities, may be said to
have a real and a nominal price. Its real price may be said to consist in
the quantity of the necessaries and conveniencies of life which are given
for it ; its nominal price, in the quantity of money. The labourer is rich
or poor, is well or ill rewarded, in proportion to the real, not to the
nominal price of his labour.

The distinction between the real and the nominal price of commodities and
labour is not a matter of mere speculation, but may sometimes be of
considerable use in practice. The same real price is always of the same
value; but on account of the variations in the value of gold and silver, the
same nominal price is sometimes of very different values. When a landed
estate, therefore, is sold with a reservation of a perpetual rent, if it is
intended that this rent should always be of the same value, it is of
importance to the family in whose favour it is reserved, that it should not
consist in a particular sum of money. Its value would in this case be liable
to variations of two different kinds: first, to those which arise from the
different quantities of gold and silver which are contained at different
times in coin of the same denomination; and, secondly, to those which arise
from the different values of equal quantities of gold and silver at
different times.

Princes and sovereign states have frequently fancied that they had a
temporary interest to diminish the quantity of pure metal contained in their
coins; but they seldom have fancied that they had any to augment it. The
quantity of metal contained in the coins, I believe of all nations, has
accordingly been almost continually diminishing, and hardly ever augmenting.
Such variations, therefore, tend almost always to diminish the value of a
money rent.

The discovery of the mines of America diminished the value of gold and
silver in Europe. This diminution, it is commonly supposed, though I
apprehend without any certain proof, is still going on gradually, and is
likely to continue to do so for a long time. Upon this supposition,
therefore, such variations are more likely to diminish than to augment the
value of a money rent, even though it should be stipulated to be paid, not
in such a quantity of coined money of such a denomination (in so many pounds
sterling, for example), but in so many ounces, either of pure silver, or of
silver of a certain standard.

The rents which have been reserved in corn, have preserved their value much
better than those which have been reserved in money, even where the
denomination of the coin has not been altered. By the 18th of Elizabeth, it
was enacted, that a third of the rent of all college leases should be
reserved in corn, to be paid either in kind, or according to the current
prices at the nearest public market. The money arising from this corn rent,
though originally but a third of the whole, is, in the present times,
according to Dr. Blackstone, commonly near double of what arises from the
other two-thirds. The old money rents of colleges must, according to this
account, have sunk almost to a fourth part of their ancient value, or are
worth little more than a fourth part of the corn which they were formerly
worth. But since the reign of Philip and Mary, the denomination of the
English coin has undergone little or no alteration, and the same number of
pounds, shillings, and pence, have contained very nearly the same quantity
of pure silver. This degradation, therefore, in the value of the money rents
of colleges, has arisen altogether from the degradation in the price of
silver.

When the degradation in the value of silver is combined with the diminution
of the quantity of it contained in the coin of the same denomination, the
loss is frequently still greater. In Scotland, where the denomination of the
coin has undergone much greater alterations than it ever did in England, and
in France, where it has undergone still greater than it ever did in
Scotland, some ancient rents, originally of considerable value, have, in
this manner, been reduced almost to nothing.

Equal quantities of labour will, at distant times, be purchased more nearly
with equal quantities of corn, the subsistence of the labourer, than with
equal quantities of gold and silver, or, perhaps, of any other commodity.
Equal quantities of corn, therefore, will, at distant times, be more nearly
of the same real value, or enable the possessor to purchase or command more
nearly the same quantity of the labour of other people. They will do this, I
say, more nearly than equal quantities of almost any other commodity; for
even equal quantities of corn will not do it exactly. The subsistence of the
labourer, or the real price of labour, as I shall endeavour to shew
hereafter, is very different upon different occasions ; more liberal in a
society advancing to opulence, than in one that is standing still, and in
one that is standing still, than in one that is going backwards. Every
other commodity, however, will, at any particular time, purchase a greater
or smaller quantity of labour, in proportion to the quantity of subsistence
which it can purchase at that time. A rent, therefore, reserved in corn, is
liable only to the variations in the quantity of labour which a certain
quantity of corn can purchase. But a rent reserved in any other commodity is
liable, not only to the variations in the quantity of labour which any
particular quantity of corn can purchase, but to the variations in the
quantity of corn which can be purchased by any particular quantity of that
commodity.

Though the real value of a corn rent, it is to be observed, however, varies
much less from century to century than that of a money rent, it varies much
more from year to year. The money price of labour, as I shall endeavour to
shew hereafter, does not fluctuate from year to year with the money price of
corn, but seems to be everywhere accommodated, not to the temporary or
occasional, but to the average or ordinary price of that necessary of life.
The average or ordinary price of corn, again is regulated, as I shall
likewise endeavour to shew hereafter, by the value of silver, by the
richness or barrenness of the mines which supply the market with that metal,
or by the quantity of labour which must be employed, and consequently of
corn which must be consumed, in order to bring any particular quantity of
silver from the mine to the market. But the value of silver, though it
sometimes varies greatly from century to century, seldom varies much from
year to year, but frequently continues the same, or very nearly the same,
for half a century or a century together. The ordinary or average money
price of corn, therefore, may, during so long a period, continue the same,
or very nearly the same, too, and along with it the money price of labour,
provided, at least, the society continues, in other respects, in the same,
or nearly in the same, condition. In the mean time, the temporary and
occasional price of corn may frequently be double one year of what it had
been the year before, or fluctuate, for example, from five-and-twenty to
fifty shillings the quarter. But when corn is at the latter price, not only
the nominal, but the real value of a corn rent, will be double of what it is
when at the former, or will command double the quantity either of labour, or
of the greater part of other commodities; the money price of labour, and
along with it that of most other things, continuing the same during all
these fluctuations.

Labour, therefore, it appears evidently, is the only universal, as well as
the only accurate, measure of value, or the only standard by which we can
compare the values of different commodities, at all times, and at all
places. We cannot estimate, it is allowed, the real value of different
commodities from century to century by the quantities of silver which were
given for them. We cannot estimate it from year to year by the quantities of
corn. By the quantities of labour, we can, with the greatest accuracy,
estimate it, both from century to century, and from year to year. From
century to century, corn is a better measure than silver, because, from
century to century, equal quantities of corn will command the same quantity
of labour more nearly than equal quantities of silver. From year to year, on
the contrary, silver is a better measure than corn, because equal quantities
of it will more nearly command the same quantity of labour.

But though, in establishing perpetual rents, or even in letting very long
leases, it may be of use to distinguish between real and nominal price; it
is of none in buying and selling, the more common and ordinary transactions.
of human life.

At the same time and place, the real and the nominal price of all
commodities are exactly in proportion to one another. The more or less money
you get for any commodity, in the London market, for example, the more or
less labour it will at that time and place enable you to purchase or
command. At the same time and place, therefore, money is the exact measure
of the real exchangeable value of all commodities. It is so, however, at the
same time and place only.

Though at distant places there is no regular proportion between the real and
the money price of commodities, yet the merchant who carries goods from the
one to the other, has nothing to consider but the money price, or the
difference between the quantity of silver for which he buys them, and that
for which he is likely to sell them. Half an ounce of silver at Canton in
China may command a greater quantity both of labour and of the necessaries
and conveniencies of life, than an ounce at London. A commodity, therefore,
which sells for half an ounce of silver at Canton, may there be really
dearer, of more real importance to the man who possesses it there, than a
commodity which sells for an ounce at London is to the man who possesses it
at London. If a London merchant, however, can buy at Canton, for half an
ounce of silver, a commodity which he can afterwards sell at London for an
ounce, he gains a hundred per cent. by the bargain, just as much as if an
ounce of silver was at London exactly of the same value as at Canton. It is
of no importance to him that half an ounce of silver at Canton would have
given him the command of more labour, and of a greater quantity of the
necessaries and conveniencies of life than an ounce can do at London. An
ounce at London will always give him the command of double the quantity of
all these, which half an ounce could have done there, and this is precisely
what he wants.

As it is the nominal or money price of goods, therefore, which finally
determines the prudence or imprudence of all purchases and sales, and
thereby regulates almost the whole business of common life in which price is
concerned, we cannot wonder that it should have been so much more attended
to than the real price.

In such a work as this, however, it may sometimes be of use to compare the
different real values of a particular commodity at different times and
places, or the different degrees of power over the labour of other people
which it may, upon different occasions, have given to those who possessed
it. We must in this case compare, not so much the different quantities of
silver for which it was commonly sold, as the different quantities or labour
which those different quantities of silver could have purchased. But the
current prices of labour, at distant times and places, can scarce ever be
known with any degree of exactness. Those of corn, though they have in few
places been regularly recorded, are in general better known, and have been
more frequently taken notice of by historians and other writers. We must
generally, therefore, content ourselves with them, not as being always
exactly in the same proportion as the current prices of labour, but as being
the nearest approximation which can commonly be had to that proportion. I
shall hereafter have occasion to make several comparisons of this kind.

In the progress of industry, commercial nations have found it convenient to
coin several different metals into money; gold for larger payments, silver
for purchases of moderate value, and copper, or some other coarse metal, for
those of still smaller consideration, They have always, however, considered
one of those metals as more peculiarly the measure of value than any of the
other two; and this preference seems generally to have been given to the
metal which they happen first to make use of as the instrument of commerce.
Having once begun to use it as their standard, which they must have done
when they had no other money, they have generally continued to do so even
when the necessity was not the same.

The Romans are said to have had nothing but copper money till within five
years before the first Punic war  (Pliny, lib. xxxiii. cap. 3), when they
first began to coin silver. Copper, therefore, appears to have continued
always the measure of value in that republic. At Rome all accounts appear to
have been kept, and the value of all estates to have been computed, either
in asses or in sestertii. The as was always the denomination of a copper
coin. The word sestertius signifies two asses and a half. Though the
sestertius, therefore, was originally a silver coin, its value was estimated
in copper. At Rome, one who owed a great deal of money was said to have a
great deal of other people's copper.

The northern nations who established themselves upon the ruins of the
Roman empire, seem to have had silver money from the first beginning of
their settlements, and not to have known either gold or copper coins for
several ages thereafter. There were silver coins in England in the time of
the Saxons ; but there was little gold coined till the time of Edward III
nor any copper till that of James I. of Great Britain. In England,
therefore, and for the same reason, I believe, in all other modern nations
of Europe, all accounts are kept, and the value of all goods and of all
estates is generally computed, in silver: and when we mean to express the
amount of a person's fortune, we seldom mention the number of guineas, but
the number of pounds sterling which we suppose would be given for it.

Originally, in all countries, I believe, a legal tender of payment could be
made only in the coin of that metal which was peculiarly considered as the
standard or measure of value. In England, gold was not considered as a legal
tender for a long time after it was coined into money. The proportion
between the values of gold and silver money was not fixed by any public law
or proclamation, but was left to be settled by the market. If a debtor
offered payment in gold, the creditor might either reject such payment
altogether, or accept of it at such a valuation of the gold as he and his
debtor could agree upon. Copper is not at present a legal tender, except in
the change of the smaller silver coins.

In this state of things, the distinction between the metal which was the
standard, and that which was not the standard, was something more than a
nominal distinction.

In process of time, and as people became gradually more familiar with the
use of the different metals in coin, and consequently better acquainted with
the proportion between their respective values, it has, in most countries, I
believe, been found convenient to ascertain this proportion, and to declare
by a public law, that a guinea, for example, of such a weight and fineness,
should exchange for one-and-twenty shillings, or be a legal tender for a debt
of that amount. In this state of things, and during the continuance of any
one regulated proportion of this kind, the distinction between the metal,
which is the standard, and that which is not the standard, becomes little
more than a nominal distinction.

In consequence of any change, however, in this regulated proportion, this
distinction becomes, or at least seems to become, something more than
nominal again. If the regulated value of a guinea, for example, was either
reduced to twenty, or raised to two-and-twenty shillings, all accounts being
kept, and almost all obligations for debt being expressed, in silver money,
the greater part of payments could in either case be made with the same
quantity of silver money as before; but would require very different
quantities of gold money ; a greater in the one case, and a smaller in the
other. Silver would appear to be more invariable in its value than gold.
Silver would appear to measure the value of gold, and gold would not appear
to measure the value of silver. The value of gold would seem to depend upon
the quantity of silver which it would exchange for, and the value of silver
would not seem to depend upon the quantity of gold which it would exchange
for. This difference, however, would be altogether owing to the custom of
keeping accounts, and of expressing the amount of all great and small sums
rather in silver than in gold money. One of Mr Drummond's notes for
five-and-twenty or fifty guineas would, after an alteration of this kind, be
still payable with five-and-twenty or fifty guineas, in the same manner as
before. It would, after such an alteration, be payable with the same
quantity of gold as before, but with very different quantities of silver. In
the payment of such a note, gold would appear to be more invariable in its
value than silver. Gold would appear to measure the value of silver, and
silver would not appear to measure the value of gold. If the custom of
keeping accounts, and of expressing promissory-notes and other obligations
for money, in this manner should ever become general, gold, and not silver,
would be considered as the metal which was peculiarly the standard or
measure of value.

 In reality, during the continuance of any one regulated proportion between the respective
values of the different metals in coin, the value of the most precious metal regulates the value
of the whole coin. Twelve copper pence contain half a pound avoirdupois of copper, of not the
best quality, which, before it is coined, is seldom worth seven-pence in silver. But as, by the
regulation, twelve such pence are ordered to exchange for a shilling, they are in the market
considered as worth a shilling, and a shilling can at any time be had for them. Even before the
late reformation of the gold coin of Great Britain, the gold, that part of it at least which
circulated in London and its neighbourhood, was in general less degraded below its standard
weight than the greater part of the silver. One-and-twenty worn and defaced shillings,
however, were considered as equivalent to a guinea, which, perhaps, indeed, was worn and
defaced too, but seldom so much so. The late regulations have brought the gold coin as near,
perhaps, to its standard weight as it is possible to bring the current coin of any nation; and the
order to receive no gold at the public offices but by weight, is likely to preserve it so, as long
as that order is enforced. The silver coin still continues in the same worn and degraded state as
before the reformation of the cold coin. In the market, however, one-and-twenty shillings of
this degraded silver coin are still considered as worth a guinea of this excellent gold coin.

The reformation of the gold coin has evidently raised the value of the silver coin which can be
exchanged for it.

In the English mint, a pound weight of gold is coined into forty-four guineas and a half, which
at one-and-twenty shillings the guinea, is equal to forty-six pounds fourteen shillings and
sixpence. An ounce of such gold coin, therefore, is worth  3:17:10 in silver. In England, no
duty or seignorage is paid upon the coinage, and he who carries a pound weight or an ounce
weight of standard gold bullion to the mint, gets back a pound weight or an ounce weight of
gold in coin, without any deduction. Three pounds seventeen shillings and tenpence halfpenny
an ounce, therefore, is said to be the mint price of gold in England, or the quantity of gold
coin which the mint gives in return for standard gold bullion.

Before the reformation of the gold coin, the price of standard gold bullion in the market had,
for many years, been upwards of 3:18s. sometimes  3:19s. and very frequently 4 an ounce;
that sum, it is probable, in the worn and degraded gold coin, seldom containing more than an
ounce of standard gold. Since the reformation of the gold coin, the market price of standard
gold bullion seldom exceeds  3:17:7 an ounce. Before the reformation of the gold coin, the
market price was always more or less above the mint price. Since that reformation, the market
price has been constantly below the mint price. But that market price is the same whether it is
paid in gold or in silver coin. The late reformation of the gold coin, therefore, has raised not
only the value of the gold coin, but likewise that of the silver coin in proportion to gold
bullion, and probably, too, in proportion to all other commodities ; though the price of the
greater part of other commodities being influenced by so many other causes, the rise in the
value of either gold or silver coin in proportion to them may not be so distinct and sensible.

In the English mint, a pound weight of standard silver bullion is coined into sixty-two
shillings, containing, in the same manner, a pound weight of standard silver. Five shillings
and twopence an ounce, therefore, is said to be the mint price of silver in England, or the
quantity of silver coin which the mint gives in return for standard silver bullion. Before the
reformation of the gold coin, the market price of standard silver bullion was, upon different
occasions, five shillings and fourpence, five shillings and fivepence, five shillings and
sixpence, five shillings and sevenpence, and very often five shillings and eightpence an ounce.
Five shillings and sevenpence, however, seems to have been the most common price. Since
the reformation of the gold coin, the market price of standard silver bullion has fallen
occasionally to five shillings and threepence, five shillings and fourpence, and five shillings
and fivepence an ounce, which last price it has scarce ever exceeded. Though the market price
of silver bullion has fallen considerably since the reformation of the gold coin, it has not fallen
so low as the mint price.

In the proportion between the different metals in the English coin, as copper is rated very
much above its real value, so silver is rated somewhat below it. In the market of Europe, in the
French coin and in the Dutch coin, an ounce of fine gold exchanges for about fourteen ounces
of fine silver. In the English coin, it exchanges for about fifteen ounces, that is, for more silver
than it is worth, according to the common estimation of Europe. But as the price of copper in
bars is not, even in England, raised by the high price of copper in English coin, so the price of
silver in bullion is not sunk by the low rate of silver in English coin. Silver in bullion still
preserves its proper proportion to gold, for the same reason that copper in bars preserves its
proper proportion to silver.

Upon the reformation of the silver coin, in the reign of William III., the price of silver bullion
still continued to be somewhat above the mint price. Mr Locke imputed this high price to the
permission of exporting silver bullion, and to the prohibition of exporting silver coin. This
permission of exporting, he said, rendered the demand for silver bullion greater than the
demand for silver coin.     But the number of people who want silver coin for the common
uses of buying and selling at home, is surely much greater than that of those who want silver
bullion either for the use of exportation or for any other use. There subsists at present a like
permission of exporting gold bullion, and a like prohibition of exporting gold coin; and yet the
price of gold bullion has fallen below the mint price. But in the English coin, silver was then,
in the same manner as now, under-rated in proportion to gold; and the gold coin (which at that
time, too, was not supposed to require any reformation) regulated then, as well as now, the
real value of the whole coin. As the reformation of the silver coin did not then reduce the price
of silver bullion to the mint price, it is not very probable that a like reformation will do so
now.

Were the silver coin brought back as near to its standard weight as the gold, a guinea, it is
probable, would, according to the present proportion, exchange for more silver in coin than it
would purchase in bullion. The silver coin containing its full standard weight, there would in
this case, be a profit in melting it down, in order, first to sell the bullion for gold coin, and
afterwards to exchange this gold coin for silver coin, to be melted down in the same manner.
Some alteration in the present proportion seems to be the only method of preventing this
inconveniency.

The inconveniency, perhaps, would be less, if silver was rated in the coin as much above its
proper proportion to gold as it is at present rated below it, provided it was at the same time
enacted, that silver should not be a legal tender for more than the change of a guinea, in the
same manner as copper is not a legal tender for more than the change of a shilling. No creditor
could, in this case, be cheated in consequence of the high valuation of silver in coin ; as no
creditor can at present be cheated in consequence of the high valuation of copper. The bankers
only would suffer by this regulation. When a run comes upon them, they sometimes
endeavour to gain time, by paying in sixpences, and they would be precluded by this
regulation from this discreditable method of evading immediate payment.They would be
obliged, in consequence, to keep at all times in their coffers a greater quantity of cash than at
present ; and though this might, no doubt, be a considerable inconveniency to them, it would,
at the same time, be a considerable security to their creditors.

Three pounds seventeen shillings and tenpence halfpenny (the mint price of gold) certainly
does not contain, even in our present excellent gold coin, more than an ounce of standard
gold, and it may be thought, therefore, should not purchase more standard bullion. But gold in
coin is more convenient than gold in bullion ; and though, in England, the coinage is free, yet
the gold which is carried in bullion to the mint, can seldom be returned in coin to the owner
till after a delay of several weeks. In the present hurry of the mint, it could not be returned till
after a delay of several months. This delay is equivalent to a small duty, and renders gold in
coin somewhat more valuable than an equal quantity of gold in bullion. If, in the English coin,
silver was rated according to its proper proportion to gold, the price of silver bullion would
probably fall below the mint price, even without any reformation of the silver coin ; the value
even of the present worn and defaced silver coin being regulated by the value of the excellent
gold coin for which it can be changed.

A small seignorage or duty upon the coinage of both gold and silver, would probably increase
still more the superiority of those metals in coin above an equal quantity of either of them in
bullion.     The coinage would, in this case, increase the value of the metal coined in
proportion to the extent of this small duty, for the same reason that the fashion increases the
value of plate in proportion to the price of that fashion. The superiority of coin above bullion
would prevent the melting down of the coin, and would discourage its exportation.     If, upon
any public exigency, it should become necessary to export the coin, the greater part of it
would soon return again, of its own accord. Abroad, it could sell only for its weight in bullion.
At home, it would buy more than that weight. There would be a profit, therefore, in bringing it
home again. In France, a seignorage of about eight per cent. is imposed upon the coinage, and
the French coin, when exported, is said to return home again, of its own accord.

The occasional fluctuations in the market price of gold and silver bullion arise from the same
causes as the like fluctuations in that of all other commodities. The frequent loss of those
metals from various accidents by sea and by land, the continual waste of them in gilding and
plating, in lace and embroidery, in the wear and tear of coin, and in that of plate, require, in all
countries which possess no mines of their own, a continual importation, in order to repair this
loss and this waste.     The merchant importers, like all other merchants, we may believe,
endeavour, as well as they can, to suit their occasional importations to what they judge is
likely to be the immediate demand. With all their attention, however, they sometimes overdo
the business, and sometimes underdo it. When they import more bullion than is wanted, rather
than incur the risk and trouble of exporting it again, they are sometimes willing to sell a part
of it for something less than the ordinary or average price. When, on the other hand, they
import less than is wanted, they get something more than this price. But when, under all those
occasional fluctuations, the market price either of gold or silver bullion continues for several
years together steadily and constantly, either more or less above, or more or less below the
mint price, we may be assured that this steady and constant, either superiority or inferiority of
price, is the effect of something in the state of the coin, which, at that time, renders a certain
quantity of coin either of more value or of less value than the precise quantity of bullion
which it ought to contain. The constancy and steadiness of the effect supposes a
proportionable constancy and steadiness in the cause.

The money of any particular country is, at any particular time and place, more or less an
accurate measure or value, according as the current coin is more or less exactly agreeable to
its standard, or contains more or less exactly the precise quantity of pure gold or pure silver
which it ought to contain. If in England, for example, forty-four guineas and a half contained
exactly a pound weight of standard gold, or eleven ounces of fine gold, and one ounce of
alloy, the gold coin of England would be as accurate a measure of the actual value of goods at
any particular time and place as the nature of the thing would admit. But if, by rubbing and
wearing, forty-four guineas and a half generally contain less than a pound weight of standard
gold, the diminution, however, being greater in some pieces than in others, the measure of
value comes to be liable to the same sort of uncertainty to which all other weights and
measures are commonly exposed. As it rarely happens that these are exactly agreeable to their
standard, the merchant adjusts the price of his goods as well as he can, not to what those
weights and measures ought to be, but to what, upon an average, he finds, by experience, they
actually are. In consequence of a like disorder in the coin, the price of goods comes, in the
same manner, to be adjusted, not to the quantity of pure gold or silver which the coin ought to
contain, but to that which, upon an average, it is found, by experience, it actually does
contain.

By the money price of goods, it is to be observed, I understand always the quantity of pure
gold or silver for which they are sold, without any regard to the denomination of the coin. Six
shillings and eight pence, for example, in the time of Edward I., I consider as the same money
price with a pound sterling in the present times, because it contained, as nearly as we can
judge, the same quantity of pure silver.




CHAPTER   VI.

OF THE COMPONENT PART OF THE PRICE OF COMMODITIES.

In that early and rude state of society which precedes both the accumulation
of stock and the appropriation of land, the proportion between the
quantities of labour necessary for acquiring different objects, seems to be
the only circumstance which can afford any rule for exchanging them for one
another. If among a nation of hunters, for example, it usually costs twice
the labour to kill a beaver which it does to kill a deer, one beaver should
naturally exchange for or be worth two deer. It is natural that what is
usually the produce of two days or two hours labour, should be worth double
of what is usually the produce of one day's or one hour's labour.

If the one species of labour should be more severe than the other, some
allowance will naturally be made for this superior hardship; and the produce
of one hour's labour in the one way may frequently exchange for that of two
hour's labour in the other.

Or if the one species of labour requires an uncommon degree of dexterity
and ingenuity, the esteem which men have for such talents, will naturally
give a value to their produce, superior to what would be due to the time
employed about it. Such talents can seldom be acquired but in consequence of
long application, and the superior value of their produce may frequently be
no more than a reasonable compensation for the time and labour which must be
spent in acquiring them. In the advanced state of society, allowances of
this kind, for superior hardship and superior skill, are commonly made in
the wages of labour ; and something of the same kind must probably have
taken place in its earliest and rudest period.

In this state of things, the whole produce of labour belongs to the
labourer; and the quantity of labour commonly employed in acquiring or
producing any commodity, is the only circumstance which can regulate the
quantity of labour which it ought commonly to purchase, command, or exchange
for.

As soon as stock has accumulated in the hands of particular persons, some of
them will naturally employ it in setting to work industrious people, whom
they will supply with materials and subsistence, in order to make a profit
by the sale of their work, or by what their labour adds to the value of the
materials. In exchanging the complete manufacture either for money, for
labour, or for other goods, over and above what may be sufficient to pay the
price of the materials, and the wages of the workmen, something must be given
for the profits of the undertaker of the work, who hazards his stock in this
adventure. The value which the workmen add to the materials, therefore,
resolves itself in this case into two parts, of which the one pays their
wages, the other the profits of their employer upon the whole stock of
materials and wages which he advanced. He could have no interest to employ
them, unless he expected from the sale of their work something more than
what was sufficient to replace his stock to him ; and he could have no
interest to employ a great stock rather than a small one, unless his profits
were to bear some proportion to the extent of his stock.

The profits of stock, it may perhaps be thought, are only a different name
for the wages of a particular sort of labour, the labour of inspection and
direction. They are, however, altogether different, are regulated by quite
different principles, and bear no proportion to the quantity, the hardship,
or the ingenuity of this supposed labour of inspection and direction. They
are regulated altogether by the value of the stock employed, and are greater
or smaller in proportion to the extent of this stock. Let us suppose, for
example, that in some particular place, where the common annual profits of
manufacturing stock are ten per cent. there are two different manufactures,
in each of which twenty workmen are employed, at the rate of fifteen pounds
a year each, or at the expense of three hundred a-year in each manufactory.
Let us suppose, too, that the coarse materials annually wrought up in the
one cost only seven hundred pounds, while the finer materials in the other
cost seven thousand. The capital annually employed in the one will, in this
case, amount only to one thousand pounds; whereas that employed in the other
will amount to seven thousand three hundred pounds. At the rate of ten per
cent. therefore, the undertaker of the one will expect a yearly profit of
about one hundred pounds only; while that of the other will expect about
seven hundred and thirty pounds. But though their profits are so very
different, their labour of inspection and direction may be either altogether
or very nearly the same. In many great works, almost the whole labour of
this kind is committed to some principal clerk. His wages properly express
the value of this labour of inspection and direction. Though in settling
them some regard is had commonly, not only to his labour and skill, but to
the trust which is reposed in him, yet they never bear any regular
proportion to the capital of which he oversees the management ; and the
owner of this capital, though he is thus discharged of almost all labour,
still expects that his profit should bear a regular proportion to his
capital. In the price of commodities, therefore, the profits of stock
constitute a component part altogether different from the wages of labour, and
regulated by quite different principles.

In this state of things, the whole produce of labour does not always belong
to the labourer. He must in most cases share it with the owner of the stock
which employs him. Neither is the quantity of labour commonly employed in
acquiring or producing any commodity, the only circumstance which can
regulate the quantity which it ought commonly to purchase, command or
exchange for. An additional quantity, it is evident, must be due for the
profits of the stock which advanced the wages and furnished the materials of
that labour.

As soon as the land of any country has all become private property, the
landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and
demand a rent even for its natural produce. The wood of the forest, the
grass of the field, and all the natural fruits of the earth, which, when
land was in common, cost the labourer only the trouble of gathering them,
come, even to him, to have an additional price fixed upon them. He must then
pay for the licence to gather them, and must give up to the landlord a
portion of what his labour either collects or produces. This portion, or,
what comes to the same thing, the price of this portion, constitutes the
rent of land, and in the price of the greater part of commodities, makes a
third component part.

The real value of all the different component parts of price, it must be
observed, is measured by the quantity of labour which they can, each of
them, purchase or command. Labour measures the value, not only of that part
of price which resolves itself into labour, but of that which resolves
itself into rent, and of that which resolves itself into profit.

In every society, the price of every commodity finally resolves itself into
some one or other, or all of those three parts ; and in every improved
society, all the three enter, more or less, as component parts, into the
price of the far greater part of commodities.

In the price of corn, for example, one part pays the rent of the landlord,
another pays the wages or maintenance of the labourers and labouring cattle
employed in producing it, and the third pays the profit of the farmer. These
three parts seem either immediately or ultimately to make up the whole price
of corn. A fourth part, it may perhaps be thought is necessary for replacing
the stock of the farmer, or for compensating the wear and tear of his
labouring cattle, and other instruments of husbandry. But it must be
considered, that the price of any instrument of husbandry, such as a
labouring horse, is itself made up of the same time parts ; the rent of the
land upon which he is reared, the labour of tending and rearing him, and the
profits of the farmer, who advances both the rent of this land, and the
wages of this labour. Though the price of the corn, therefore, may pay the
price as well as the maintenance of the horse, the whole price still
resolves itself, either immediately or ultimately, into the same three parts
of rent, labour, and profit.

In the price of flour or meal, we must add to the price of the corn, the
profits of the miller, and the wages of his servants ; in the price of
bread, the profits of the baker, and the wages of his servants; and in the
price of both, the labour of transporting the corn from the house of the
farmer to that of the miller, and from that of the miller to that of the
baker, together with the profits of those who advance the wages of that
labour.

The price of flax resolves itself into the same three parts as that of corn.
In the price of linen we must add to this price the wages of the
flax-dresser, of the spinner, of the weaver, of the bleacher, etc. together
with the profits of their respective employers.

As any particular commodity comes to be more manufactured, that part of the
price which resolves itself into wages and profit, comes to be greater in
proportion to that which resolves itself into rent. In the progress of the
manufacture, not only the number of profits increase, but every subsequent
profit is greater than the foregoing ; because the capital from which it is
derived must always be greater. The capital which employs the weavers, for
example, must be greater than that which employs the spinners; because it
not only replaces that capital with its profits, but pays, besides, the
wages of the weavers : and the profits must always bear some proportion to
the capital.

In the most improved societies, however, there are always a few commodities
of which the price resolves itself into two parts only the wages of labour,
and the profits of stock ; and a still smaller number, in which it consists
altogether in the wages of labour. In the price of sea-fish, for example,
one part pays the labour of the fisherman, and the other the profits of the
capital employed in the fishery. Rent very seldom makes any part of it,
though it does sometimes, as I shall shew hereafter. It is otherwise, at
least through the greater part of Europe, in river fisheries. A salmon
fishery pays a rent ; and rent, though it cannot well be called the rent of
land, makes a part of the price of a salmon, as well as wares and profit. In
some parts of Scotland, a few poor people make a trade of gathering, along
the sea-shore, those little variegated stones commonly known by the name of
Scotch pebbles. The price which is paid to them by the stone-cutter, is
altogether the wages of their labour ; neither rent nor profit makes an part
of it.

But the whole price of any commodity must still finally resolve itself into some one or other
or all of those three parts; as whatever part of it remains after paying the rent of the land, and
the price of the whole labour employed in raising, manufacturing, and bringing it to market,
must necessarily be profit to somebody.

As the price or exchangeable value of every particular commodity, taken
separately, resolves itself into some one or other, or all of those three
parts ; so that of all the commodities which compose the whole annual
produce of the labour of every country, taken complexly, must resolve itself
into the same three parts, and be parcelled out among different inhabitants
of the country, either as the wages of their labour, the profits of their
stock, or the rent of their land. The whole of what is annually either
collected or produced by the labour of every society, or, what comes to the
same thing, the whole price of it, is in this manner originally distributed
among some of its different members. Wages, profit, and rent, are the three
original sources of all revenue, as well as of all exchangeable value. All
other revenue is ultimately derived from some one or other of these.

Whoever derives his revenue from a fund which is his own, must draw it
either from his labour, from his stock, or from his land. The revenue
derived from labour is called wages; that derived from stock, by the person
who manages or employs it, is called profit; that derived from it by the
person who does not employ it himself, but lends it to another, is called
the interest or the use of money. It is the compensation which the borrower
pays to the lender, for the profit which he has an opportunity of making by
the use of the money. Part of that profit naturally belongs to the borrower,
who runs the risk and takes the trouble of employing it, and part to the
lender, who affords him the opportunity of making this profit. The interest
of money is always a derivative revenue, which, if it is not paid from the
profit which is made by the use of the money, must be paid from some other
source of revenue, unless perhaps the borrower is a spendthrift, who
contracts a second debt in order to pay the interest of the first. The
revenue which proceeds altogether from land, is called rent, and belongs to
the landlord. The revenue of the farmer is derived partly from his labour,
and partly from his stock. To him, land is only the instrument which enables
him to earn the wages of this labour, and to make the profits of this stock.
All taxes, and all the revenue which is founded upon them, all salaries,
pensions, and annuities of every kind, are ultimately derived from some one
or other of those three original sources of revenue, and are paid either
immediately or mediately from the wages of labour, the profits of stock, or
the rent of land.

When those three different sorts of revenue belong to different persons,
they are readily distinguished; but when they belong to the same, they are
sometimes confounded with one another, at least in common language.

A gentleman who farms a part of his own estate, after paying the expense of
cultivation, should gain both the rent of the landlord and the profit of the
farmer. He is apt to denominate, however, his whole gain, profit, and thus
confounds rent with profit, at least in common language. The greater part of
our North American and West Indian planters are in this situation. They
farm, the greater part of them, their own estates : and accordingly we
seldom hear of the rent of a plantation, but frequently of its profit.

Common farmers seldom employ any overseer to direct the general operations
of the farm. They generally, too, work a good deal with their own hands, as
ploughmen, harrowers, etc. What remains of the crop, after paying the rent,
therefore, should not only replace to them their stock employed in
cultivation, together with its ordinary profits, but pay them the wages
which are due to them, both as labourers and overseers. Whatever remains,
however, after paying the rent and keeping up the stock, is called profit.
But wages evidently make a part of it. The farmer, by saving these wages,
must necessarily gain them. Wages, therefore, are in this case confounded
with profit.

An independent manufacturer, who has stock enough both to purchase
materials, and to maintain himself till he can carry his work to market,
should gain both the wages of a journeyman who works under a master, and the
profit which that master makes by the sale of that journeyman's work. His
whole gains, however, are commonly called profit, and wages are, in this
case, too, confounded with profit.

A gardener who cultivates his own garden with his own hands, unites in his
own person the three different characters, of landlord, farmer, and
labourer. His produce, therefore, should pay him the rent of the first, the
profit of the second, and the wages of the third. The whole, however, is
commonly considered as the earnings of his labour. Both rent and profit are,
in this case, confounded with wages.

As in a civilized country there are but few commodities of which the
exchangeable value arises from labour only, rent and profit contributing
largely to that of the far greater part of them, so the annual produce of
its labour will always be sufficient to purchase or command a much greater
quantity of labour than what was employed in raising, preparing, and
bringing that produce to market. If the society were annually to employ all
the labour which it can annually purchase, as the quantity of labour would
increase greatly every year, so the produce of every succeeding year would
be of vastly greater value than that of the foregoing. But there is no
country in which the whole annual produce is employed in maintaining the
industrious. The idle everywhere consume a great part of it; and, according
to the different proportions in which it is annually divided between those
two different orders of people, its ordinary or average value must either
annually increase or diminish, or continue the same from one year to
another.




CHAPTER   VII.

OF THE NATURAL AND MARKET PRICE OF COMMODITIES.

There is in every society or neighbourhood an ordinary or average rate, both
of wages and profit, in every different employment of labour and stock. This
rate is naturally regulated, as I shall shew hereafter, partly by the
general circumstances of the society, their riches or poverty, their
advancing, stationary, or declining condition, and partly by the particular
nature of each employment.

There is likewise in every society or neighbourhood an ordinary or average
rate of rent, which is regulated, too, as I shall shew hereafter, partly by
the general circumstances of the society or neighbourhood in which the land
is situated, and partly by the natural or improved fertility of the land.

These ordinary or average rates may be called the natural rates of wages,
profit and rent, at the time and place in which they commonly prevail.

When the price of any commodity is neither more nor less than what is
sufficient to pay the rent of the land, the wages of the labour, and the
profits of the stock employed in raising, preparing, and bringing it to
market, according to their natural rates, the commodity is then sold for
what may be called its natural price.

The commodity is then sold precisely for what it is worth, or for what it
really costs the person who brings it to market; for though, in common
language, what is called the prime cost of any commodity does not comprehend
the profit of the person who is to sell it again, yet, if he sells it at a
price which does not allow him the ordinary rate of profit in his
neighbourhood, he is evidently a loser by the trade; since, by employing his
stock in some other way, he might have made that profit.  His profit,
besides, is his revenue, the proper fund of his subsistence. As, while he is
preparing and bringing the goods to market, he advances to his workmen their
wages, or their subsistence ; so he advances to himself, in the same manner,
his own subsistence, which is generally suitable to the profit which he may
reasonably expect from the sale of his goods. Unless they yield him this
profit, therefore, they do not repay him what they may very properly be said
to have really cost him.

Though the price, therefore, which leaves him this profit, is not always the
lowest at which a dealer may sometimes sell his goods, it is the lowest at
which he is likely to sell them for any considerable time; at least where
there is perfect liberty, or where he may change his trade as often as he
pleases.

The actual price at which any commodity is commonly sold, is called its
market price. It may either be above, or below, or exactly the same with its
natural price.

The market price of every particular commodity is regulated by the
proportion between the quantity which is actually brought to market, and the
demand of those who are willing to pay the natural price of the commodity,
or the whole value of the rent, labour, and profit, which must be paid in
order to bring it thither. Such people may be called the effectual
demanders, and their demand the effectual demand; since it maybe sufficient
to effectuate the bringing of the commodity to market. It is different from
the absolute demand. A very poor man may be said, in some sense, to have a
demand for a coach and six; he might like to have it; but his demand is not
an effectual demand, as the commodity can never be brought to market in
order to satisfy it.

When the quantity of any commodity which is brought to market falls short of
the effectual demand, all those who are willing to pay the whole value of
the rent, wages, and profit, which must be paid in order to bring it
thither, cannot be supplied with the quantity which they want. Rather than
want it altogether, some of them will be willing to give more. A competition
will immediately begin among them, and the market price will rise more or
less above the natural price, according as either the greatness of the
deficiency, or the wealth and wanton luxury of the competitors, happen to
animate more or less the eagerness of the competition. Among competitors of
equal wealth and luxury, the same deficiency will generally occasion a more
or less eager competition, according as the acquisition of the commodity
happens to be of more or less importance to them. Hence the exorbitant price
of the necessaries of life during the blockade of a town, or in a famine.

When the quantity brought to market exceeds the effectual demand, it cannot
be all sold to those who are willing to pay the whole value of the rent,
wages, and profit, which must be paid in order to bring it thither. Some
part must be sold to those who are willing to pay less, and the low price
which they give for it must reduce the price of the whole. The market price
will sink more or less below the natural price, according as the greatness
of the excess increases more or less the competition of the sellers, or
according as it happens to be more or less important to them to get
immediately rid of the commodity. The same excess in the importation of
perishable, will occasion a much greater competition than in that of durable
commodities; in the importation of oranges, for example, than in that of old
iron.

When the quantity brought to market is just sufficient to supply the
effectual demand, and no more, the market price naturally comes to be either
exactly, or as nearly as can be judged of, the same with the natural price.
The whole quantity upon hand can be disposed of for this price, and can not
be disposed of for more. The competition of the different dealers obliges
them all to accept of this price, but does not oblige them to accept of
less.

The quantity of every commodity brought to market naturally suits itself to
the effectual demand. It is the interest of all those who employ their land,
labour, or stock, in bringing any commodity to market, that the quantity
never should exceed the effectual demand ; and it is the interest of all
other people that it never should fall short of that demand.

If at any time it exceeds the effectual demand, some of the component parts
of its price must be paid below their natural rate. If it is rent, the
interest of the landlords will immediately prompt them to withdraw a part of
their land; and if it is wages or profit, the interest of the labourers in
the one case, and of their employers in the other, will prompt them to
withdraw a part of their labour or stock, from this employment. The quantity
brought to market will soon be no more than sufficient to supply the
effectual demand. All the different parts of its price will rise to their
natural rate, and the whole price to its natural price.

If, on the contrary, the quantity brought to market should at any time fall
short of the effectual demand, some of the component parts of its price must
rise above their natural rate. If it is rent, the interest of all other
landlords will naturally prompt them to prepare more land for the raising of
this commodity ; if it is wages or profit, the interest of all other
labourers and dealers will soon prompt them to employ more labour and stock
in preparing and bringing it to market. The quantity brought thither will
soon be sufficient to supply the effectual demand. All the different parts
of its price will soon sink to their natural rate, and the whole price to
its natural price.

The natural price, therefore, is, as it were, the central price, to which
the prices of all commodities are continually gravitating. Different
accidents may sometimes keep them suspended a good deal above it, and
sometimes force them down even somewhat below it. But whatever may be the
obstacles which hinder them from settling in this centre of repose and
continuance, they are constantly tending towards it.

The whole quantity of industry annually employed in order to bring any
commodity to market, naturally suits itself in this manner to the effectual
demand. It naturally aims at bringing always that precise quantity thither
which may be sufficient to supply, and no more than supply, that demand.

But, in some employments, the same quantity of industry will, in different
years, produce very different quantities of commodities ; while, in others,
it will produce always the same, or very nearly the same. The same number of
labourers in husbandry will, in different years, produce very different
quantities of corn, wine, oil, hops, etc. But the same number of spinners or
weavers will every year produce the same, or very nearly the same, quantity
of linen and woollen cloth. It is only the average produce of the one
species of industry which can be suited, in any respect, to the effectual
demand ; and as its actual produce is frequently much greater, and
frequently much less, than its average produce, the quantity of the
commodities brought to market will sometimes exceed a good deal, and
sometimes fall short a good deal, of the effectual demand. Even though that
demand, therefore, should continue always the same, their market price will
be liable to great fluctuations, will sometimes fall a good deal below, and
sometimes rise a good deal above, their natural price. In the other species
of industry, the produce of equal quantities of labour being always the
same, or very nearly the same, it can be more exactly suited to the
effectual demand. While that demand continues the same, therefore, the
market price of the commodities is likely to do so too, and to be either
altogether, or as nearly as can be judged of, the same with the natural
price. That the price of linen and woollen cloth is liable neither to such
frequent, nor to such great variations, as the price of corn, every man's
experience will inform him. The price of the one species of commodities
varies only with the variations in the demand; that of the other varies not
only with the variations in the demand, but with the much greater, and more
frequent, variations in the quantity of what is brought to market, in order
to supply that demand.

The occasional and temporary fluctuations in the market price of any
commodity fall chiefly upon those parts of its price which resolve
themselves into wages and profit. That part which resolves itself into rent
is less affected by them. A rent certain in money is not in the least
affected by them, either in its rate or in its value. A rent which consists
either in a certain proportion, or in a certain quantity, of the rude
produce, is no doubt affected in its yearly value by all the occasional and
temporary fluctuations in the market price of that rude produce; but it is
seldom affected by them in its yearly rate. In settling the terms of the
lease, the landlord and farmer endeavour, according to their best judgment,
to adjust that rate, not to the temporary and occasional, but to the average
and ordinary price of the produce.

Such fluctuations affect both the value and the rate, either of wages or of
profit, according as the market happens to be either overstocked or
understocked with commodities or with labour, with work done, or with work
to be done. A public mourning raises the price of black cloth ( with which
the market is almost always understocked upon such occasions), and augments
the profits of the merchants who possess any considerable quantity of it. It
has no effect upon the wages of the weavers. The market is understocked with
commodities, not with labour, with work done, not with work to be done. It
raises the wages of journeymen tailors. The market is here understocked with
labour. There is an effectual demand for more labour, for more work to be
done, than can be had. It sinks the price of coloured silks and cloths, and
thereby reduces the profits of the merchants who have any considerable
quantity of them upon hand. It sinks, too, the wages of the workmen employed
in preparing such commodities, for which all demand is stopped for six
months, perhaps for a twelvemonth. The market is here overstocked both with
commodities and with labour.

But though the market price of every particular commodity is in this manner
continually gravitating, if one may say so, towards the natural price; yet
sometimes particular accidents, sometimes natural causes, and sometimes
particular regulations of policy, may, in many commodities, keep up the
market price, for a long time together, a good deal above the natural price.

When, by an increase in the effectual demand, the market price of some
particular commodity happens to rise a good deal above the natural price,
those who employ their stocks in supplying that market, are generally
careful to conceal this change. If it was commonly known, their great profit
would tempt so many new rivals to employ their stocks in the same way, that,
the effectual demand being fully supplied, the market price would soon be
reduced to the natural price, and, perhaps, for some time even below it. If
the market is at a great distance from the residence of those who supply it,
they may sometimes be able to keep the secret for several years together,
and may so long enjoy their extraordinary profits without any new rivals.
Secrets of this kind, however, it must be acknowledged, can seldom be long
kept; and the extraordinary profit can last very little longer than they are
kept.

Secrets in manufactures are capable of being longer kept than secrets in
trade. A dyer who has found the means of producing a particular colour with
materials which cost only half the price of those commonly made use of, may,
with good management, enjoy the advantage of his discovery as long as he
lives, and even leave it as a legacy to his posterity. His extraordinary
gains arise from the high price which is paid for his private labour. They
properly consist in the high wages of that labour. But as they are repeated
upon every part of his stock, and as their whole amount bears, upon that
account, a regular proportion to it, they are commonly considered as
extraordinary profits of stock.

Such enhancements of the market price are evidently the effects of
particular accidents, of which, however, the operation may sometimes last
for many years together.

Some natural productions require such a singularity of soil and situation,
that all the land in a great country, which is fit for producing them, may
not be sufficient to supply the effectual demand. The whole quantity brought
to market, therefore, may be disposed of to those who are willing to give
more than what is sufficient to pay the rent of the land which produced
them, together with the wages of the labour and the profits of the stock
which were employed in preparing and bringing them to market, according to
their natural rates. Such commodities may continue for whole centuries
together to be sold at this high price ; and that part of it which resolves
itself into the rent of land, is in this case the part which is generally
paid above its natural rate. The rent of the land which affords such
singular and esteemed productions, like the rent of some vineyards in France
of a peculiarly happy soil and situation, bears no regular proportion to the
rent of other equally fertile and equally well cultivated land in its
neighbourhood. The wages of the labour, and the profits of the stock
employed in bringing such commodities to market, on the contrary, are seldom
out of their natural proportion to those of the other employments of labour
and stock in their neighbourhood.

Such enhancements of the market price are evidently the effect of natural
causes, which may hinder the effectual demand from ever being fully
supplied, and which may continue, therefore, to operate for ever.

A monopoly granted either to an individual or to a trading company, has the
same effect as a secret in trade or manufactures. The monopolists, by
keeping the market constantly understocked by never fully supplying the
effectual demand, sell their commodities much above the natural price, and
raise their emoluments. whether they consist in wages or profit, greatly
above their natural rate.

The price of monopoly is upon every occasion the highest which can be got.
The natural price, or the price of free competition, on the contrary, is the
lowest which can be taken, not upon every occasion indeed, but for any
considerable time together. The one is upon every occasion the highest which
can be squeezed out of the buyers, or which it is supposed they will
consent to give; the other is the lowest which the sellers can commonly
afford to take, and at the same time continue their business.

The exclusive privileges of corporations, statutes of apprenticeship, and
all those laws which restrain in particular employments, the competition to
a smaller number than might otherwise go into them, have the same tendency,
though in a less degree. They are a sort of enlarged monopolies, and may
frequently, for ages together, and in whole classes of employments, keep up
the market price of particular commodities above the natural price, and
maintain both the wages of the labour and the profits of the stock employed
about them somewhat above their natural rate.

Such enhancements of the market price may last as long as the regulations of
policy which give occasion to them.

The market price of any particular commodity, though it may continue long
above, can seldom continue long below, its natural price. Whatever part of
it was paid below the natural rate, the persons whose interest it affected
would immediately feel the loss, and would immediately withdraw either so
much land or no much labour, or so much stock, from being employed about it,
that the quantity brought to market would soon be no more than sufficient to
supply the effectual demand. Its market price, therefore, would soon rise to
the natural price; this at least would be the case where there was perfect
liberty.

The same statutes of apprenticeship and other corporation laws, indeed,
which, when a manufacture is in prosperity, enable the workman to raise his
wages a good deal above their natural rate, sometimes oblige him, when it
decays, to let them down a good deal below it. As in the one case they
exclude many people from his employment, so in the other they exclude him
from many employments. The effect of such regulations, however, is not near
so durable in sinking the workman's wages below, as in raising them above
their natural rate. Their operation in the one way may endure for many
centuries, but in the other it can last no longer than the lives of some of
the workmen who were bred to the business in the time of its prosperity.
When they are gone, the number of those who are afterwards educated to the
trade will naturally suit itself to the effectual demand. The policy must be
as violent as that of Indostan or ancient Egypt (where every man was bound
by a principle of religion to follow the occupation of his father, and was
supposed to commit the most horrid sacrilege if he changed it for another),
which can in any particular employment, and for several generations
together, sink either the wages of labour or the profits of stock below
their natural rate.

This is all that I think necessary to be observed at present concerning the
deviations, whether occasional or permanent, of the market price of
commodities from the natural price.

The natural price itself varies with the natural rate of each of its
component parts, of wages, profit, and rent; and in every society this rate
varies according to their circumstances, according to their riches or
poverty, their advancing, stationary, or declining condition. I shall, in
the four following chapters, endeavour to explain, as fully and distinctly
as I can, the causes of those different variations.

First, I shall endeavour to explain what are the circumstances which
naturally determine the rate of wages, and in what manner those
circumstances are affected by the riches or poverty, by the advancing,
stationary, or declining state of the society.

Secondly, I shall endeavour to shew what are the circumstances which
naturally determine the rate of profit ; and in what manner, too, those
circumstances are affected by the like variations in the state of the
society.

Though pecuniary wages and profit are very different in the different
employments of labour and stock ; yet a certain proportion seems commonly to
take place between both the pecuniary wages in all the different employments
of labour, and the pecuniary profits in all the different employments of
stock. This proportion, it will appear hereafter, depends partly upon the
nature of the different employments, and partly upon the different laws and
policy of the society in which they are carried on. But though in many
respects dependent upon the laws and policy, this proportion seems to be
little affected by the riches or poverty of that society, by its advancing,
stationary, or declining condition, but to remain the same, or very nearly
the same, in all those different states. I shall, in the third place,
endeavour to explain all the different circumstances which regulate this
proportion.

In the fourth and last place, I shall endeavour to shew what are the
circumstances which regulate the rent of land, and which either raise or
lower the real price of all the different substances which it produces.




CHAPTER   VIII.

OF THE WAGES OF LABOUR.

The produce of labour constitutes the natural recompence or wages of labour.

In that original state of things which precedes both the appropriation of
land and the accumulation of stock, the whole produce of labour belongs to
the labourer. He has neither landlord nor master to share with him.

Had this state continued, the wages of labour would have augmented with all
those improvements in its productive powers, to which the division of labour
gives occasion. All things would gradually have become cheaper. They would
have been produced by a smaller quantity of labour ; and as the commodities
produced by equal quantities of labour would naturally in this state of
things be exchanged for one another, they would have been purchased likewise
with the produce of a smaller quantity.

But though all things would have become cheaper in reality, in appearance
many things might have become dearer, than before, or have been exchanged
for a greater quantity of other goods. Let us suppose, for example, that in
the greater part of employments the productive powers of labour had been
improved to tenfold, or that a day's labour could produce ten times the
quantity of work which it had done originally ; but that in a particular
employment they had been improved only to double, or that a day's labour
could produce only twice the quantity of work which it had done before. In
exchanging the produce of a day's labour in the greater part of employments
for that of a day's labour in this particular one, ten times the original
quantity of work in them would purchase only twice the original quantity in
it. Any particular quantity in it, therefore, a pound weight, for example,
would appear to be five times dearer than before. In reality, however, it
would be twice as cheap. Though it required five times the quantity of other
goods to purchase it, it would require only half the quantity of labour
either to purchase or to produce it. The acquisition, therefore, would be
twice as easy as before.

But this original state of things, in which the labourer enjoyed the whole
produce of his own labour, could not last beyond the first introduction of
the appropriation of land and the accumulation of stock. It was at an end,
therefore, long before the most considerable improvements were made in the
productive powers of labour ; and it would be to no purpose to trace further
what might have been its effects upon the recompence or wages of labour.

As soon as land becomes private property, the landlord demands a share of
almost all the produce which the labourer can either raise or collect from
it. His rent makes the first deduction from the produce of the labour which
is employed upon land.

It seldom happens that the person who tills the ground has wherewithal to
maintain himself till he reaps the harvest. His maintenance is generally
advanced to him from the stock of a master, the farmer who employs him, and
who would have no interest to employ him, unless he was to share in the
produce of his labour, or unless his stock was to be replaced to him with a
profit. This profit makes a second deduction from the produce of the labour
which is employed upon land.

The produce of almost all other labour is liable to the like deduction of
profit. In all arts and manufactures, the greater part of the workmen stand
in need of a master, to advance them the materials of their work, and their
wages and maintenance, till it be completed. He shares in the produce of
their labour, or in the value which it adds to the materials upon which it
is bestowed; and in this share consists his profit.

It sometimes happens, indeed, that a single independent workman has stock
sufficient both to purchase the materials of his work, and to maintain
himself till it be completed. He is both master and workman, and enjoys the
whole produce of his own labour, or the whole value which it adds to the
materials upon which it is bestowed. It includes what are usually two
distinct revenues, belonging to two distinct persons, the profits of stock,
and the wages of labour.

Such cases, however, are not very frequent; and in every part of Europe
twenty workmen serve under a master for one that is independent, and the
wages of labour are everywhere understood to be, what they usually are, when
the labourer is one person, and the owner of the stock which employs him
another.

What are the common wages of labour, depends everywhere upon the contract
usually made between those two parties, whose interests are by no means the
same. The workmen desire to get as much, the masters to give as little, as
possible. The former are disposed to combine in order to raise, the latter
in order to lower, the wages of labour.

It is not, however, difficult to foresee which of the two parties must, upon
all ordinary occasions, have the advantage in the dispute, and force the
other into a compliance with their terms. The masters, being fewer in
number, can combine much more easily: and the law, besides, authorises, or
at least does not prohibit, their combinations, while it prohibits those of
the workmen. We have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the
price of work, but many against combining to raise it. In all such disputes,
the masters can hold out much longer. A landlord, a farmer, a master
manufacturer, or merchant, though they did not employ a single workman,
could generally live a year or two upon the stocks, which they have already
acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month,
and scarce any a year, without employment. In the long run, the workman may
be as necessary to his master as his master is to him ; but the necessity is
not so immediate.

We rarely hear, it has been said, of the combinations of masters, though
frequently of those of workmen. But whoever imagines, upon this account,
that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the subject.
Masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant and
uniform, combination, not to raise the wages of labour above their actual
rate. To violate this combination is everywhere a most unpopular action, and
a sort of reproach to a master among his neighbours and equals. We seldom,
indeed, hear of this combination, because it is the usual, and, one may say,
the natural state of things, which nobody ever hears of. Masters, too,
sometimes enter into particular combinations to sink the wages of labour
even below this rate. These are always conducted with the utmost silence and
secrecy till the moment of execution; and when the workmen yield, as they
sometimes do without resistance, though severely felt by them, they are
never heard of by other people. Such combinations, however, are frequently
resisted by a contrary defensive combination of the workmen, who sometimes,
too, without any provocation of this kind, combine, of their own accord, to
raise tile price of their labour. Their usual pretences are, sometimes the
high price of provisions, sometimes the great profit which their masters
make by their work. But whether their combinations be offensive or
defensive, they are always abundantly heard of. In order to bring the point
to a speedy decision, they have always recourse to the loudest clamour, and
sometimes to the most shocking violence and outrage. They are desperate, and
act with the folly and extravagance of desperate men, who must either
starve, or frighten their masters into an immediate compliance with their
demands. The masters, upon these occasions, are just as clamorous upon the
other side, and never cease to call aloud for the assistance of the civil
magistrate, and the rigorous execution of those laws which have been enacted
with so much severity against the combination of servants, labourers, and
journeymen. The workmen, accordingly, very seldom derive any advantage from
the violence of those tumultuous combinations, which, partly from the
interposition of the civil magistrate, partly from the superior steadiness
of the masters, partly from the necessity which the greater part of the
workmen are under of submitting for the sake of present subsistence,
generally end in nothing but the punishment or ruin of the ringleaders.

But though, in disputes with their workmen, masters must generally have
the advantage, there is, however, a certain rate, below which it seems
impossible to reduce, for any considerable time, the ordinary wages even of
the lowest species of labour.

A man must always live by his work, and his wages must at least be
sufficient to maintain him. They must even upon most occasions be somewhat
more, otherwise it would be impossible for him to bring up a family. and the
race of such workmen could not last beyond the first generation. Mr
Cantillon seems, upon this account, to suppose that the lowest species of
common labourers must everywhere earn at least double their own maintenance,
in order that, one with another, they may be enabled to bring up two
children; the labour of the wife, on account of her necessary attendance on
the children, being supposed no more than sufficient to provide for herself:
But one half the children born, it is computed, die before the age of
manhood. The poorest labourers, therefore, according to this account, must,
one with another, attempt to rear at least four children, in order; that two
may have an equal chance of living to that age. But the necessary
maintenance of four children, it is supposed, may be nearly equal to that of
one man. The labour of an able-bodied slave, the same author adds, is
computed to be worth double his maintenance ; and that of the meanest
labourer, he thinks, cannot be worth less than that of an able-bodied slave.
Thus far at least seems certain, that, in order to bring up a family, the
labour of the husband and wife together must, even in the lowest species of
common labour, be able to earn something more than what is precisely
necessary for their own maintenance; but in what proportion, whether in that
above-mentioned, or many other, I shall not take upon me to determine.

There are certain circumstances, however, which sometimes give the labourers
an advantage, and enable them to raise their wages considerably above this
rate, evidently the lowest which is consistent with common humanity.

When in any country the demand for those who live by wages, labourers,
journeymen, servants of every kind, is continually increasing; when every
year furnishes employment for a greater number than had been employed the
year before, the workmen have no occasion to combine in order to raise their
wages. The scarcity of hands occasions a competition among masters, who bid
against one another in order to get workmen, and thus voluntarily break
through the natural combination of masters not to raise wages. The demand
for those who live by wages, it is evident, cannot increase but in proportion
to the increase of the funds which are destined to the payment of
wages. These funds are of two kinds, first, the revenue which is over and
above what is necessary for the maintenance; and, secondly, the stock which
is over and above what is necessary for the employment of their masters.

When the landlord, annuitant, or monied man, has a greater revenue than what
he judges sufficient to maintain his own family, he employs either the whole
or a part of the surplus in maintaining one or more menial servants.
Increase this surplus, and he will naturally increase the number of those
servants.

When an independent workman, such as a weaver or shoemaker, has got more
stock than what is sufficient to purchase the materials of his own work, and
to maintain himself till he can dispose of it, he naturally employs one or
more journeymen with the surplus, in order to make a profit by their work.
Increase this surplus, and he will naturally increase the number of his
journeymen.

The demand for those who live by wages, therefore, necessarily increases
with the increase of the revenue and stock of every country, and cannot
possibly increase without it. The increase of revenue and stock is the
increase of national wealth. The demand for those who live by wages,
therefore, naturally increases with the increase of national wealth, and
cannot possibly increase without it.

It is not the actual greatness of national wealth, but its continual
increase, which occasions a rise in the wages of labour. It is not,
accordingly, in the richest countries, but in the most thriving, or in those
which are growing rich the fastest, that the wages of labour are highest.
England is certainly, in the present times, a much richer country than any
part of North America. The wages of labour, however, are much higher in
North America than in any part of England. In the province of New York,
common labourers earned  in 1773, before the commencement
of the late disturbances, three shillings and sixpence currency, equal to
two shillings sterling, a-day ; ship-carpenters, ten shillings and sixpence
currency, with a pint of rum, worth sixpence sterling, equal in all to six
shillings and sixpence sterling; house-carpenters and bricklayers, eight
shillings currency, equal to four shillings and sixpence sterling ;
journeymen tailors, five shillings currency, equal to about two shillings
and tenpence sterling. These prices are all above the London price ; and
wages are said to be as high in the other colonies as in New York. The price
of provisions is everywhere in North America much lower than in England. A
dearth has never been known there. In the worst seasons they have always had
a sufficiency for themselves, though less for exportation. If the money
price of labour, therefore, be higher than it is anywhere in the
mother-country, its real price, the real command of the necessaries and
conveniencies of life which it conveys to the labourer, must be higher in a
still greater proportion.

But though North America is not yet so rich as England, it is much more
thriving, and advancing with much greater rapidity to the further
acquisition of riches. The most decisive mark of the prosperity of any
country is the increase of the number of its inhabitants.      In Great
Britain, and most other European countries, they are not supposed to double
in less than five hundred years.      In the British colonies in North
America, it has been found that they double in twenty or five-and-twenty
years. Nor in the present times is this increase principally owing to the
continual importation of new inhabitants, but to the great multiplication of
the species. Those who live to old age, it is said, frequently see there
from fifty to a hundred, and sometimes many more, descendants from their own
body. Labour is there so well rewarded, that a numerous family of children,
instead of being a burden, is a source of opulence and prosperity to the
parents. The labour of each child, before it can leave their house, is
computed to be worth a hundred pounds clear gain to them. A young widow with
four or five young children, who, among the middling or inferior ranks of
people in Europe, would have so little chance for a second husband, is there
frequently courted as a sort of fortune. The value of children is the
greatest of all encouragements to marriage. We cannot, therefore, wonder
that the people in North America should generally marry very young.
Notwithstanding the great increase occasioned by such early marriages, there
is a continual complaint of the scarcity of hands in North America. The
demand for labourers, the funds destined for maintaining them increase, it
seems, still faster than they can find labourers to employ.

Though the wealth of a country should be very great, yet if it has been long
stationary, we must not expect to find the wages of labour very high in it.
The funds destined for the payment of wages, the revenue and stock of its
inhabitants, may be of the greatest extent; but if they have continued for
several centuries of the same, or very nearly of the same extent, the number
of labourers employed every year could easily supply, and even more than
supply, the number wanted the following year. There could seldom be any
scarcity of hands, nor could the masters be obliged to bid against one
another in order to get them. The hands, on the contrary, would, in this
case, naturally multiply beyond their employment. There would be a constant
scarcity of employment, and the labourers would be obliged to bid against
one another in order to get it. If in such a country the wages off labour had
ever been more than sufficient to maintain the labourer, and to enable him
to bring up a family, the competition of the labourers and the interest of
the masters would soon reduce them to the lowest rate which is consistent
with common humanity. China has been long one of the richest, that is, one
of the most fertile, best cultivated, most industrious, and most populous,
countries in the world. It seems, however, to have been long stationary.
Marco Polo, who visited it more than five hundred years ago, describes its
cultivation, industry, and populousness, almost in the same terms in which
they are described by travellers in the present times. It had, perhaps, even
long before his time, acquired that full complement of riches which the
nature of its laws and institutions permits it to acquire. The accounts of
all travellers, inconsistent in many other respects, agree in the low wages
of labour, and in the difficulty which a labourer finds in bringing up a
family in China. If by digging the ground a whole day he can get what will
purchase a small quantity of rice in the evening, he is contented. The
condition of artificers is, if possible, still worse. Instead of waiting
indolently in their work-houses for the calls of their customers, as in
Europe, they are continually running about the streets with the tools of
their respective trades, offering their services, and, as it were, begging
employment. The poverty of the lower ranks of people in China far surpasses
that of the most beggarly nations in Europe. In the neighbourhood of Canton,
many hundred, it is commonly said, many thousand families have no habitation
on the land, but live constantly in little fishing-boats upon the rivers and
canals. The subsistence which they find there is so scanty, that they are
eager to fish up the nastiest garbage thrown overboard from any European
ship. Any carrion, the carcase of a dead dog or cat, for example, though
half putrid and stinking, is as welcome to them as the most wholesome food
to the people of other countries. Marriage is encouraged in China, not by
the profitableness of children, but by the liberty of destroying them. In
all great towns, several are every night exposed in the street, or drowned
like puppies in the water. The performance of this horrid office is even
said to be the avowed business by which some people earn their subsistence.

China, however, though it may, perhaps, stand still, does not seem to go
backwards. Its towns are nowhere deserted by their inhabitants. The lands
which had once been cultivated, are nowhere neglected. The same, or very
nearly the same, annual labour, must, therefore, continue to be performed,
and the funds destined for maintaining it must not, consequently, be
sensibly diminished. The lowest class of labourers, therefore,
notwithstanding their scanty subsistence, must some way or another make
shift to continue their race so far as to keep up their usual numbers.

But it would be otherwise in a country where the funds destined for the
maintenance of labour were sensibly decaying. Every year the demand for
servants and labourers would, in all the different classes of employments,
be less than it had been the year before. Many who had been bred in the
superior classes, not being able to find employment in their own business,
would be glad to seek it in the lowest. The lowest class being not only
overstocked with its own workmen, but with the overflowings of all the other
classes, the competition for employment would be so great in it, as to
reduce the wages of labour to the most miserable and scanty subsistence of
the labourer. Many would not he able to find employment even upon these hard
terms, but would either starve, or be driven to seek a subsistence, either
by begging, or by the perpetration perhaps, of the greatest enormities.
Want, famine, and mortality, would immediately prevail in that class, and
from thence extend themselves to all the superior classes, till the number
of inhabitants in the country was reduced to what could easily be maintained
by the revenue and stock which remained in it, and which had escaped either
the tyranny or calamity which had destroyed the rest. This, perhaps, is
nearly the present state of Bengal, and of some other of the English
settlements in the East Indies. In a fertile country, which had before been
much depopulated, where subsistence, consequently, should not be very
difficult, and where, notwithstanding, three or four hundred thousand people
die of hunger in one year, we maybe assured that the funds destined for the
maintenance of the labouring poor are fast decaying. The difference between
the genius of the British constitution, which protects and governs North
America, and that of the mercantile company which oppresses and domineers in
the East Indies, cannot, perhaps, be better illustrated than by the
different state of those countries.

The liberal reward of labour, therefore, as it is the necessary effect, so
it is the natural symptom of increasing national wealth. The scanty
maintenance of the labouring poor, on the other hand, is the natural symptom
that things are at a stand, and their starving condition, that they are
going fast backwards.

In Great Britain, the wages of labour seem, in the present times, to be
evidently more than what is precisely necessary to enable the labourer to
bring up a family. In order to satisfy ourselves upon this point, it will
not be necessary to enter into any tedious or doubtful calculation of what
may be the lowest sum upon winch it is possible to do this. There are many
plain symptoms, that the wages of labour are nowhere in this country
regulated by this lowest rate, which is consistent with common humanity.

First, in almost every part of Great Britain there is a distinction, even in
the lowest species of labour, between summer and winter wages. Summer wages
are always highest. But, on account of the extraordinary expense of fuel,
the maintenance of a family is most expensive in winter. Wages, therefore,
being highest when this expense is lowest, it seems evident that they are
not regulated by what is necessary for this expense, but by the quantity and
supposed value of the work. A labourer, it may be said, indeed, ought to
save part of his summer wages, in order to defray his winter expense; and
that, through the whole year, they do not exceed what is necessary to
maintain his family through the whole year. A slave, however, or one
absolutely dependent on us for immediate subsistence, would not be treated
in this manner. His daily subsistence would be proportioned to his daily
necessities.
     Secondly, the wages of labour do not, in Great Britain, fluctuate with
the price of provisions. These vary everywhere from year to year, frequently
from month to month. But in many places, the money price of labour remains
uniformly the same, sometimes for half a century together. If, in these
places, therefore, the labouring poor can maintain their families in dear
years, they must be at their ease in times of moderate plenty, and in
affluence in those of extraordinary cheapness. The high price of provisions
during these ten years past, has not, in many parts of the kingdom, been
accompanied with any sensible rise in the money price of labour. It has,
indeed, in some ; owing, probably, more to the increase of the demand for
labour, than to that of the price of provisions.

Thirdly, as the price of provisions varies more from year to year than the
wages of labour, so, on the other hand, the wages of labour vary more from
place to place than the price of provisions. The prices of bread and
butchers' meat are generally the same, or very nearly the same, through the
greater part of the united kingdom. These, and most other things which are
sold by retail, the way in which the labouring poor buy all things, are
generally fully as cheap, or cheaper, in great towns than in the remoter
parts of the country, for reasons which I shall have occasion to explain
hereafter. But the wages of labour in a great town and its neighbourhood,
are frequently a fourth or a fifth part, twenty or five-and--twenty per
cent. higher than at a few miles distance. Eighteen pence a day may be
reckoned the common price of labour in London and its neighbourhood. At a
few miles distance. it falls to fourteen and fifteen pence. Tenpence may be
reckoned its price in Edinburgh and its neighbourhood. At a few miles
distance, it falls to eightpence, the usual price of common labour through
the greater part of the low country of Scotland, where it varies a good deal
less than in England. Such a difference of prices, which, it seems, is not
always sufficient to transport a man from one parish to another, would
necessarily occasion so great a transportation of the most bulky
commodities, not only from one parish to another, but from one end of the
kingdom, almost from one end of the world to the other, as would soon reduce
them more nearly to a level. After all that has been said of the levity and
inconstancy of human nature, it appears evidently from experience, that man
is, of all sorts of luggage, the most difficult to be transported. If the
labouring poor, therefore, can maintain their families in those parts of the
kingdom where the price of labour is lowest, they must be in affluence where
it is highest.

Fourthly, the variations in the price of labour not only do not correspond,
either in place or time, with those in the price of provisions, but they are
frequently quite opposite.

Grain, the food of the common people, is dearer in Scotland than in England,
whence Scotland receives almost every year very large supplies. But English
corn must be sold dearer in Scotland, the country to which it is brought,
than in England, the country from which it comes; and in proportion to its
quality it cannot be sold dearer in Scotland than the Scotch corn that comes
to the same market in competition with it. The quality of grain depends
chiefly upon the quantity of flour or meal which it yields at the mill ;
and, in this respect, English grain is so much superior to the Scotch, that
though often dearer in appearance, or in proportion to the measure of its
bulk, it is generally cheaper in reality, or in proportion to its quality,
or even to the measure of its weight. The price of labour, on the contrary,
is dearer in England than in Scotland. If the labouring poor, therefore, can
maintain their families in the one part of the united kingdom, they must be
in affluence in the other. Oatmeal, indeed, supplies the common people in
Scotland with the greatest and the best part of their food, which is, in
general, much inferior to that of their neighbours of the same rank in
England. This difference, however, in the mode of their subsistence, is not
the cause, but the effect, of the difference in their wages; though, by a
strange misapprehension, I have frequently heard it represented as the
cause. It is not because one man keeps a coach, while his neighbour walks
a-foot, that the one is rich, and the other poor; but because the one is
rich, he keeps a coach, and because the other is poor, he walks a-foot.

During the course of the last century, taking one year with another, grain
was dearer in both parts of the united kingdom than during that of the
present. This is a matter of fact which cannot now admit of any reasonable
doubt ; and the proof of it is, if possible, still more decisive with regard
to Scotland than with regard to England. It is in Scotland supported by the
evidence of the public fiars, annual valuations made upon oath, according to
the actual state of the markets, of all the different sorts of grain in
every different county of Scotland. If such direct proof could require any
collateral evidence to confirm it, I would observe, that this has likewise
been the case in France, and probably in most other parts of Europe. With
regard to France, there is the clearest proof. But though it is certain,
that in both parts of the united kingdom grain was somewhat dearer in the
last century than in the present, it is equally certain that labour was much
cheaper. If the labouring poor, therefore, could bring up their families
then, they must be much more at their ease now. In the last century, the
most usual day-wages of common labour through the greater part of Scotland
were sixpence in summer, and fivepence in winter. Three shillings a-week,
the same price, very nearly still continues to be paid in some parts of the
Highlands and Western islands. Through the greater part of the Low country,
the most usual wages of common labour are now eight pence a-day ; tenpence,
sometimes a shilling, about Edinburgh, in the counties which border upon
England, probably on account of that neighbourhood, and in a few other
places where there has lately been a considerable rise in the demand for
labour, about Glasgow, Carron, Ayrshire, etc. In England, the improvements
of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, began much earlier than in
Scotland. The demand for labour, and consequently its price, must
necessarily have increased with those improvements. In the last century,
accordingly, as well as in the present, the wages of labour were higher in
England than in Scotland. They have risen, too, considerably since that
time, though, on account of the greater variety of wages paid there in
different places, it is more difficult to ascertain how much. In 1614, the
pay of a foot soldier was the same as in the present times, eightpence
a-day. When it was first established, it would naturally be regulated by the
usual wages of common labourers, the rank of people from which foot soldiers
are commonly drawn. Lord-chief-justice Hales, who wrote in the time of
Charles II. computes the necessary expense of a labourer's family,
consisting of six persons, the father and mother, two children able to do
something, and two not able, at ten shillings a-week, or twenty-six pounds
a-year. If they cannot earn this by their labour, they must make it up, he
supposes, either by begging or stealing. He appears to have enquired very
carefully into this subject  {See his scheme for the maintenance of the
poor, in Burn's History of the Poor Laws.}. In 1688, Mr Gregory King, whose
skill in political arithmetic is so much extolled by Dr Davenant, computed
the ordinary income of labourers and out-servants to be fifteen pounds
a-year to a family, which he supposed to consist, one with another, of three
and a half persons. His calculation, therefore, though different in
appearance, corresponds very nearly at bottom with that of Judge Hales. Both
suppose the weekly expense of such families to be about twenty-pence a-head.
Both the pecuniary income and expense of such families have increased
considerably since that time through the greater part of the kingdom, in
some places more, and in some less, though perhaps scarce anywhere so much
as some exaggerated accounts of the present wages of labour have lately
represented them to the public. The price of labour, it must be observed,
cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere, different prices being often
paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour, not only according
to the different abilities of the workman, but according to the easiness or
hardness of the masters. Where wages are not regulated by law, all that we
can pretend to determine is, what are the most usual; and experience seems
to shew that law can never regulate them properly, though it has often
pretended to do so.

The real recompence of labour, the real quantity of the necessaries and
conveniencies of life which it can procure to the labourer, has, during the
course of the present century, increased perhaps in a still greater
proportion than its money price. Not only grain has become somewhat cheaper,
but many other things, from which the industrious poor derive an agreeable
and wholesome variety of food, have become a great deal cheaper. Potatoes,
for example, do not at present, through the greater part of the kingdom,
cost half the price which they used to do thirty or forty years ago. The
same thing may be said of turnips, carrots, cabbages ; things which were
formerly never raised but by the spade, but which are now commonly raised by
the plough. All sort of garden stuff, too, has become cheaper. The greater
part of the apples, and even of the onions, consumed in Great Britain, were,
in the last century, imported from Flanders. The great improvements in the
coarser manufactories of both linen and woollen cloth furnish the labourers
with cheaper and better clothing; and those in the manufactories of the
coarser metals, with cheaper and better instruments of trade, as well as
with many agreeable and convenient pieces of household furniture. Soap,
salt, candles, leather, and fermented liquors, have, indeed, become a good
deal dearer, chiefly from the taxes which have been laid upon them. The
quantity of these, however, which the labouring poor an under any necessity
of consuming, is so very small, that the increase in their price does not
compensate the diminution in that of so many other things. The common
complaint, that luxury extends itself even to the lowest ranks of the
people, and that the labouring poor will not now be contented with the same
food, clothing, and lodging, which satisfied them in former times, may
convince us that it is not the money price of labour only, but its real
recompence, which has augmented.

Is this improvement in the circumstances of the lower ranks of the people to
be regarded as an advantage, or as an inconveniency, to the society ? The
answer seems at first abundantly plain. Servants, labourers, and workmen of
different kinds, make up the far greater part of every great political
society. But what improves the circumstances of the greater part, can never
be regarded as any inconveniency to the whole. No society can surely be
flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor
and miserable. It is but equity, besides, that they who feed, clothe, and
lodge the whole body of the people, should have such a share of the produce
of their own labour as to be themselves tolerably well fed, clothed, and
lodged.

Poverty, though it no doubt discourages, does not always prevent, marriage.
It seems even to be favourable to generation. A half-starved Highland woman
frequently bears more than twenty children, while a pampered fine lady is
often incapable of bearing any, and is generally exhausted by two or three.
Barrenness, so frequent among women of fashion, is very rare among those of
inferior station. Luxury, in the fair sex, while it inflames, perhaps, the
passion for enjoyment, seems always to weaken, and frequently to destroy
altogether, the powers of generation.

But poverty, though it does not prevent the generation, is extremely
unfavourable to the rearing of children. The tender plant is produced ; but
in so cold a soil, and so severe a climate, soon withers and dies. It is not
uncommon, I have been frequently told, in the Highlands of Scotland, for a
mother who has born twenty children not to have two alive. Several officers
of great experience have assured me, that, so far from recruiting their
regiment, they have never been able to supply it with drums and fifes, from
all the soldiers' children that were born in it. A greater number of fine
children, however, is seldom seen anywhere than about a barrack of soldiers.
Very few of them, it seems, arrive at the age of thirteen or fourteen. In
some places, one half the children die before they are four years of age, in
many places before they are seven, and in almost all places before they are
nine or ten. This great mortality, however will everywhere be found chiefly
among the children of the common people, who cannot afford to tend them with
the same care as those of better station. Though their marriages are
generally more fruitful than those of people of fashion, a smaller
proportion of their children arrive at maturity. In foundling hospitals, and
among the children brought up by parish charities, the mortality is still
greater than among those of the common people.
     Every species of animals naturally multiplies in proportion to the
means of their subsistence, and no species can ever multiply be yond it. But
in civilized society, it is only among the inferior ranks of people that the
scantiness of subsistence can set limits to the further multiplication of
the human species ; and it can do so in no other way than by destroying a
great part of the children which their fruitful marriages produce.

The liberal reward of labour, by enabling them to provide better for their
children, and consequently to bring up a greater number, naturally tends to
widen and extend those limits. It deserves to be remarked, too, that it
necessarily does this as nearly as possible in the proportion which the
demand for labour requires. If this demand is continually increasing, the
reward of labour must necessarily encourage in such a manner the marriage
and multiplication of labourers, as may enable them to supply that
continually increasing demand by a continually increasing population. If the
reward should at any time be less than what was requisite for this purpose,
the deficiency of hands would soon raise it ; and if it should at any time
be more, their excessive multiplication would soon lower it to this
necessary rate. The market would be so much understocked with labour in the
one case, and so much overstocked in the other, as would soon force back its
price to that proper rate which the circumstances of the society required.
It is in this manner that the demand for men, like that for any other
commodity, necessarily regulates the production of men, quickens it when it
goes on too slowly, and stops it when it advances too fast. It is this
demand which regulates and determines the state of propagation in all the
different countries of the world ; in North America, in Europe, and in China
; which renders it rapidly progressive in the first, slow and gradual in the
second, and altogether stationary in the last.

The wear and tear of a slave, it has been said, is at the expense of his
master ; but that of a free servant is at his own expense. The wear and tear
of the latter, however, is, in reality, as much at the expense of his master
as that of the former. The wages paid to journeymen and servants of every
kind must be such as may enable them, one with another to continue the race
of journeymen and servants, according as the increasing, diminishing, or
stationary demand of the society, may happen to require. But though the wear
and tear of a free servant be equally at the expense of his master, it
generally costs him much less than that of a slave. The fund destined for
replacing or repairing, if I may say so, the wear and tear of the slave, is
commonly managed by a negligent master or careless overseer. That destined
for performing the same office with regard to the freeman is managed by the
freeman himself. The disorders which generally prevail in the economy of the
rich, naturally introduce themselves into the management of the former; the
strict frugality and parsimonious attention of the poor as naturally
establish themselves in that of the latter. Under such different management,
the same purpose must require very different degrees of expense to execute
it. It appears, accordingly, from the experience of all ages and nations, I
believe, that the work done by freemen comes cheaper in the end than that
performed by slaves. It is found to do so even at Boston, New-York, and
Philadelphia, where the wages of common labour are so very high.

The liberal reward of labour, therefore, as it is the effect of increasing
wealth, so it is the cause of increasing population. To complain of it, is
to lament over the necessary cause and effect of the greatest public
prosperity.

It deserves to be remarked, perhaps, that it is in the progressive state,
while the society is advancing to the further acquisition, rather than when
it has acquired its full complement of riches, that the condition of the
labouring poor, of the great body of the people, seems to be the happiest
and the most comfortable. It is hard in the stationary, and miserable in the
declining state. The progressive state is, in reality, the cheerful and the
hearty state to all the different orders of the society; the stationary is
dull ; the declining melancholy.

The liberal reward of labour, as it encourages the propagation, so it
increases the industry of the common people. The wages of labour are the
encouragement of industry, which, like every other human quality, improves
in proportion to the encouragement it receives. A plentiful subsistence
increases the bodily strength of the labourer, and the comfortable hope of
bettering his condition, and of ending his days, perhaps, in ease and
plenty, animates him to exert that strength to the utmost. Where wages are
high, accordingly, we shall always find the workmen more active, diligent,
and expeditious, than where they are low ; in England, for example, than in
Scotland; in the neighbourhood of great towns, than in remote country
places. Some workmen, indeed, when they can earn in four days what will
maintain them through the week, will be idle the other three. This, however,
is by no means the case with the greater part. Workmen, on the contrary,
when they are liberally paid by the piece, are very apt to overwork
themselves, and to ruin their health and constitution in a few years. A
carpenter in London, and in some other places, is not supposed to last in
his utmost vigour above eight years. Something of the same kind happens in
many other trades, in which the workmen are paid by the piece; as they
generally are in manufactures, and even in country labour, wherever wages
are higher than ordinary. Almost every class of artificers is subject to
some peculiar infirmity occasioned by excessive application to their
peculiar species of work. Ramuzzini, an eminent Italian physician, has
written a particular book concerning such diseases. We do not reckon our
soldiers the most industrious set of people among us; yet when soldiers have
been employed in some particular sorts of work, and liberally paid by the
piece, their officers have frequently been obliged to stipulate with the
undertaker, that they should not be allowed to earn above a certain sum
every day, according to the rate at which they were paid. Till this
stipulation was made, mutual emulation, and the desire of greater gain,
frequently prompted them to overwork themselves, and to hurt their health by
excessive labour. Excessive application, during four days of the week, is
frequently the real cause of the idleness of the other three, so much and so
loudly complained of. Great labour, either of mind or body, continued for
several days together is, in most men, naturally followed by a great desire
of relaxation, which, if not restrained by force, or by some strong
necessity, is almost irresistible. It is the call of nature, which requires
to be relieved by some indulgence, sometimes of ease only, but sometimes too
of dissipation and diversion. If it is not complied with, the consequences
are often dangerous and sometimes fatal, and such as almost always, sooner
or later, bring on the peculiar infirmity of the trade.  If masters would
always listen to the dictates of reason and humanity, they have frequently
occasion rather to moderate, than to animate the application of many of
their workmen. It will be found, I believe, in every sort of trade, that the
man who works so moderately, as to be able to work constantly, not only
preserves his health the longest, but, in the course of the year, executes
the greatest quantity of work.

In cheap years it is pretended, workmen are generally more idle, and in dear
times more industrious than ordinary. A plentiful subsistence, therefore, it
has been concluded, relaxes, and a scanty one quickens their industry. That
a little more plenty than ordinary may render some workmen idle, cannot be
well doubted; but that it should have this effect upon the greater part, or
that men in general should work better when they are ill fed, than when they
are well fed, when they are disheartened than when they are in good spirits,
when they are frequently sick than when they are generally in good health,
seems not very probable. Years of dearth, it is to be observed, are
generally among the common people years of sickness and mortality, which
cannot fail to diminish the produce of their industry.

In years of plenty, servants frequently leave their masters, and trust their
subsistence to what they can make by their own industry. But the same
cheapness of provisions, by increasing the fund which is destined for the
maintenance of servants, encourages masters, farmers especially, to employ a
greater number. Farmers, upon such occasions, expect more profit from their
corn by maintaining a few more labouring servants, than by selling it at a
low price in the market. The demand for servants increases, while the number
of those who offer to supply that demand diminishes. The price of labour,
therefore, frequently rises in cheap years.

In years of scarcity, the difficulty and uncertainty of subsistence make all
such people eager to return to service. But the high price of provisions, by
diminishing the funds destined for the maintenance of servants, disposes
masters rather to diminish than to increase the number of those they have.
In dear years, too, poor independent workmen frequently consume the little
stock with which they had used to supply themselves with the materials of
their work, and are obliged to become journeymen for subsistence. More
people want employment than easily get it ; many are willing to take it upon
lower terms than ordinary ; and the wages of both servants and journeymen
frequently sink in dear years.

Masters of all sorts, therefore, frequently make better bargains with their
servants in dear than in cheap years, and find them more humble and
dependent in the former than in the latter. They naturally, therefore,
commend the former as more favourable to industry. Landlords and farmers,
besides, two of the largest classes of masters, have another reason for
being pleased with dear years. The rents of the one, and the profits of the
other, depend very much upon the price of provisions. Nothing can be more
absurd, however, than to imagine that men in general should work less when
they work for themselves, than when they work for other people. A poor
independent workman will generally be more industrious than even a
journeyman who works by the piece. The one enjoys the whole produce of his
own industry, the other shares it with his master. The one, in his separate
independent state, is less liable to the temptations of bad company, which,
in large manufactories, so frequently ruin the morals of the other. The
superiority of the independent workman over those servants who are hired by
the month or by the year, and whose wages and maintenance are the same,
whether they do much or do little, is likely to be still greater. Cheap
years tend to increase the proportion of independent workmen to journeymen
and servants of all kinds, and dear years to diminish it.

A French author of great knowledge and ingenuity, Mr Messance, receiver of
the taillies in the election of St Etienne, endeavours to shew that the poor
do more work in cheap than in dear years, by comparing the quantity and
value of the goods made upon those different occasions in three different
manufactures; one of coarse woollens, carried on at Elbeuf; one of linen,
and another of silk, both which extend through the whole generality of
Rouen. It appears from his account, which is copied from the registers of
the public offices, that the quantity and value of the goods made in all
those three manufactories has generally been greater in cheap than in dear
years, and that it has always been; greatest in the cheapest, and least in
the dearest years. All the three seem to be stationary manufactures, or
which, though their produce may vary somewhat from year to year, are, upon
the whole, neither going backwards nor forwards.

The manufacture of linen in Scotland, and that of coarse woollens in the
West Riding of Yorkshire, are growing manufactures, of which the produce is
generally, though with some variations, increasing both in quantity and
value. Upon examining, however, the accounts which have been published of
their annual produce, I have not been able to observe that its variations
have had any sensible connection with the dearness or cheapness of the
seasons. In 1740, a year of great scarcity, both manufactures, indeed,
appear to have declined very considerably. But in 1756, another year or
great scarcity, the Scotch manufactures made more than ordinary advances.
The Yorkshire manufacture, indeed, declined, and its produce did not rise to
what it had been in 1755, till 1766, after the repeal of the American stamp
act. In that and the following year, it greatly exceeded what it had ever
been before, and it has continued to advance ever since.

The produce of all great manufactures for distant sale must necessarily
depend, not so much upon the dearness or cheapness of the seasons in the
countries where they are carried on, as upon the circumstances which affect
the demand in the countries where they are consumed; upon peace or war, upon
the prosperity or declension of other rival manufactures and upon the good
or bad humour of their principal customers. A great part of the
extraordinary work, besides, which is probably done in cheap years, never
enters the public registers of manufactures. The men-servants, who leave
their masters, become independent labourers. The women return to their
parents, and commonly spin, in order to make clothes for themselves and
their families. Even the independent workmen do not always, work for public
sale, but are employed by some of their neighbours in manufactures for
family use. The produce of their labour, therefore, frequently makes no
figure in those public registers, of which the records are sometimes
published with so much parade, and from which our merchants and
manufacturers would often vainly pretend to announce the prosperity or
declension of the greatest empires.

Through the variations in the price of labour not only do not always
correspond with those in the price of provisions, but are frequently quite
opposite, we must not, upon this account, imagine that the price of
provisions has no influence upon that of labour. The money price of labour
is necessarily regulated by two circumstances; the demand for labour, and
the price of the necessaries and conveniencies of life. The demand for
labour, according as it happens to be increasing, stationary, or declining,
or to require an increasing, stationary, or declining population, determines
the quantities of the necessaries and conveniencies of life which must be
given to the labourer; and the money price of labour is determined by what
is requisite for purchasing this quantity. Though the money price of labour,
therefore, is sometimes high where the price of provisions is low, it would
be still higher, the demand continuing the same, if the price of provisions
was high.

It is because the demand for labour increases in years of sudden and
extraordinary plenty, and diminishes in those of sudden and extraordinary
scarcity, that the money price of labour sometimes rises in the one, and
sinks in the other.

In a year of sudden and extraordinary plenty, there are funds in the hands
of many of the employers of industry, sufficient to maintain and employ a
greater number of industrious people than had been employed the year before
; and this extraordinary number cannot always be had. Those masters,
therefore, who want more workmen, bid against one another, in order to get
them, which sometimes raises both the real and the money price of their
labour.

The contrary of this happens in a year of sudden and extraordinary scarcity.
The funds destined for employing industry are less than they had been the
year before. A considerable number of people are thrown out of employment,
who bid one against another, in order to get it, which sometimes lowers both
the real and the money price of labour. In 1740, a year of extraordinary
scarcity, many people were willing to work for bare subsistence. In the
succeeding years of plenty, it was more difficult to get labourers and
servants. The scarcity of a dear year, by diminishing the demand for labour,
tends to lower its price, as the high price of provisions tends to raise it.
The plenty of a cheap year, on the contrary, by increasing the demand, tends
to raise the price of labour, as the cheapness of provisions tends to lower
it. In the ordinary variations of the prices of provisions, those two
opposite causes seem to counterbalance one another, which is probably, in
part, the reason why the wages of labour are everywhere so much more steady
and permanent than the price of provisions.

The increase in the wages of labour necessarily increases the price of many
commodities, by increasing that part of it which resolves itself into wages,
and so far tends to diminish their consumption, both at home and abroad. The
same cause, however, which raises the wages of labour, the increase of
stock, tends to increase its productive powers, and to make a smaller
quantity of labour produce a greater quantity of work. The owner of the
stock which employs a great number of labourers necessarily endeavours, for
his own advantage, to make such a proper division and distribution of
employment, that they may be enabled to produce the greatest quantity of
work possible. For the same reason, he endeavours to supply them with the
best machinery which either he or they can think of. What takes place among
the labourers in a particular workhouse, takes place, for the same reason,
among those of a great society. The greater their number, the more they
naturally divide themselves into different classes and subdivisions of
employments. More heads are occupied in inventing the most proper machinery
for executing the work of each, and it is, therefore, more likely to be
invented. There me many commodities, therefore, which, in consequence of
these improvements, come to be produced by so much less labour than be.
fore, that the increase of its price is more than compensated by the
diminution of its quantity.




CHAPTER   IX.

OF THE PROFITS OF STOCK.

The rise and fall in the profits of stock depend upon the same causes with
the rise and fall in the wages of labour, the increasing or declining state
of the wealth of the society ; but those causes affect the one and the other
very differently.

The increase of stock, which raises wages, tends to lower profit. When the
stocks of many rich merchants are turned into the same trade, their mutual
competition naturally tends to lower its profit; and when there is a like
increase of stock in all the different trades carried on in the same
society, the same competition must produce the same effect in them all.

It is not easy, it has already been observed, to ascertain what are the
average wages of labour, even in a particular place, and at a particular
time. We can, even in this case, seldom determine more than what are the
most usual wages. But even this can seldom be done with regard to the
profits of stock. Profit is so very fluctuating, that the person who carries
on a particular trade, cannot always tell you himself what is the average of
his annual profit. It is affected, not only by every variation of price in
the commodities which he deals in, but by the good or bad fortune both of
his rivals and of his customers, and by a thousand other accidents, to which
goods, when carried either by sea or by land, or even when stored in a
warehouse, are liable. It varies, therefore, not only from year to year, but
from day to day, and almost from hour to hour. To ascertain what is the
average profit of all the different trades carried on in a great kingdom,
must be much more difficult; and to judge of what it may have been formerly,
or in remote periods of time, with any degree of precision, must be
altogether impossible.

But though it may be impossible to determine, with any degree of precision,
what are or were the average profits of stock, either in the present or in
ancient times, some notion may be formed of them from the interest of money.
It may be laid down as a maxim, that wherever a great deal can be made by
the use of money, a great deal will commonly be given for the use of it; and
that, wherever little can be made by it, less will commonly he given for it.
Accordingly, therefore, as the usual market rate of interest varies in any
country, we may be assured that the ordinary profits of stock must vary with
it, must sink as it sinks, and rise as it rises. The progress of interest,
therefore, may lead us to form some notion of the progress of profit.

By the 37th of Henry VIII. all interest above ten per cent. was declared
unlawful. More, it seems, had sometimes been taken before that. In the reign
of Edward VI. religious zeal prohibited all interest. This prohibition,
however, like all others of the same kind, is said to have produced no
effect, and probably rather increased than diminished the evil of usury. The
statute of Henry VIII. was revived by the 13th of Elizabeth, cap. 8. and ten
per cent. continued to be the legal rate of interest till the 21st of James
I. when it was restricted to eight per cent. It was reduced to six per cent.
soon after the Restoration, and by the 12th of Queen Anne, to five per cent.
All these different statutory regulations seem to have been made with great
propriety. They seem to have followed, and not to have gone before, the
market rate of interest, or the rate at which people of good credit usually
borrowed. Since the time of Queen Anne, five per cent. seems to have been
rather above than below the market rate. Before the late war, the government
borrowed at three per cent. ; and people of good credit in the capital, and
in many other parts of the kingdom, at three and a-half, four, and four and
a-half per cent.

Since the time of Henry VIII. the wealth and revenue of the country have
been continually advancing, and in the course of their progress, their pace
seems rather to have been gradually accelerated than retarded. They seem not
only to have been going on, but to have been going on faster and faster. The
wages of labour have been continually increasing during the same period,
and, in the greater part of the different branches of trade and
manufactures, the profits of stock have been diminishing.

It generally requires a greater stock to carry on any sort of trade in a
great town than in a country village. The great stocks employed in every
branch of trade, and the number of rich competitors, generally reduce the
rate of profit in the former below what it is in the latter. But the wages
of labour are generally higher in a great town than in a country village. In
a thriving town, the people who have great stocks to employ, frequently
cannot get the number of workmen they want, and therefore bid against one
another, in order to get as many as they can, which raises the wages of
labour, and lowers the profits of stock. In the remote parts of the
country, there is frequently not stock sufficient to employ all the people,
who therefore bid against one another, in order to get employment, which
lowers the wages of labour, and raises the profits of stock.

In Scotland, though the legal rate of interest is the same as in England,
the market rate is rather higher. People of the best credit there seldom
borrow under five per cent. Even private bankers in Edinburgh give four per
cent. upon their promissory-notes, of which payment, either in whole or in
part may be demanded at pleasure. Private bankers in London give no interest
for the money which is deposited with them. There are few trades which
cannot be carried on with a smaller stock in Scotland than in England. The
common rate of profit, therefore, must be somewhat greater. The wages of
labour, it has already been observed, are lower in Scotland than in England.
The country, too, is not only much poorer, but the steps by which it
advances to a better condition, for it is evidently advancing, seem to be
much slower and more tardy.
The legal rate of interest in France has not during the course of the present century, been
always regulated by the market rate { See Denisart, Article Taux des Interests, tom. iii, p.13}.
In 1720, interest was reduced from the twentieth to the fiftieth penny, or from five to two per
cent. In 1724, it was raised to the thirtieth penny, or to three and a third per cent. In 1725, it
was again raised to the twentieth penny, or to five per cent. In 1766, during the administration
of Mr Laverdy, it was reduced to the twenty-fifth penny, or to four per cent. The Abb Terray
raised it afterwards to the old rate of five per cent. The supposed purpose of many of those
violent reductions of interest was to prepare the way for reducing that of the public debts ; a
purpose which has sometimes been executed. France is, perhaps, in the present times, not so
rich a country as England; and though the legal rate of interest has in France frequently been
lower than in England, the market rate has generally been higher; for there, as in other
countries, they have several very safe and easy methods of evading the law. The profits of
trade, I have been assured by British merchants who had traded in both countries, are higher
in France than in England ; and it is no doubt upon this account, that many British subjects
chuse rather to employ their capitals in a country where trade is in disgrace, than in one where
it is highly respected. The wages of labour are lower in France than in England. When you go
from Scotland to England, the difference which you may remark between the dress and
countenance of the common people in the one country and in the other, sufficiently indicates
the difference in their condition. The contrast is still greater when you return from France.
France, though no doubt a richer country than Scotland, seems not to be going forward so fast.
It is a common and even a popular opinion in the country, that it is going backwards ; an
opinion which I apprehend, is ill-founded, even with regard to France, but which nobody can
possibly entertain with regard to Scotland, who sees the country now, and who saw it twenty
or thirty years ago.

The province of Holland, on the other hand, in proportion to the extent of
its territory and the number of its people, is a richer country than
England. The government there borrow at two per cent. and private people of
good credit at three. The wages of labour are said to be higher in Holland
than in England, and the Dutch, it is well known, trade upon lower profits
than any people in Europe. The trade of Holland, it has been pretended by
some people, is decaying, and it may perhaps be true that some particular
branches of it are so; but these symptoms seem to indicate sufficiently that
there is no general decay. When profit diminishes, merchants are very apt to
complain that trade decays, though the diminution of profit is the natural
effect of its prosperity, or of a greater stock being employed in it than
before. During the late war, the Dutch gained the whole carrying trade of
France, of which they still retain a very large share. The great property
which they possess both in French and English funds, about forty millions,
it is said in the latter (in which, I suspect, however, there is a
considerable exaggeration ), the great sums which they lend to private
people, in countries where the rate of interest is higher than in their own,
are circumstances which no doubt demonstrate the redundancy of their stock,
or that it has increased beyond what they can employ with tolerable profit
in the proper business of their own country; but they do not demonstrate
that that business has decreased. As the capital of a private man, though
acquired by a particular trade, may increase beyond what he can employ in
it, and yet that trade continue to increase too, so may likewise the capital
of a great nation.

In our North American and West Indian colonies, not only the wages of
labour, but the interest of money, and consequently the profits of stock,
are higher than in England. In the different colonies, both the legal and
the market rate of interest run from six to eight percent. High wages of
labour and high profits of stock, however, are things, perhaps, which scarce
ever go together, except in the peculiar circumstances of new colonies. A
new colony must always, for some time, be more understocked in proportion to
the extent of its territory, and more underpeopled in proportion to the
extent of its stock, than the greater part of other countries. They have
more land than they have stock to cultivate. What they have, therefore, is
applied to the cultivation only of what is most fertile and most favourably
situated, the land near the sea-shore, and along the banks of navigable
rivers. Such land, too, is frequently purchased at a price below the value
even of its natural produce. Stock employed in the purchase and improvement
of such lands, must yield a very large profit, and, consequently, afford to
pay a very large interest. Its rapid accumulation in so profitable an
employment enables the planter to increase the number of his hands faster
than he can find them in a new settlement. Those whom he can find,
therefore, are very liberally rewarded. As the colony increases, the profits
of stock gradually diminish. When the most fertile and best situated lands
have been all occupied, less profit can be made by the cultivation of what
is inferior both in soil and situation, and less interest can be afforded
for the stock which is so employed. In the greater part of our colonies,
accordingly, both the legal and the market rate of interest have been
considerably reduced during the course of the present century. As riches,
improvement, and population, have increased, interest has declined. The
wages of labour do not sink with the profits of stock. The demand for labour
increases with the increase of stock, whatever be its profits; and after
these are diminished, stock may not only continue to increase, but to
increase much faster than before. It is with industrious nations, who are
advancing in the acquisition of riches, as with industrious individuals. A
great stock, though with small profits, generally increases faster than a
small stock with great profits. Money, says the proverb, makes money. When
you have got a little, it is often easy to get more. The great difficulty is
to get that little. The connection between the increase of stock and that of
industry, or of the demand for useful labour, has partly been explained
already, but will be explained more fully hereafter, in treating of the
accumulation of stock.

The acquisition of new territory, or of new branches of trade, may sometimes
raise the profits of stock, and with them the interest of money, even in a
country which is fast advancing in the acquisition of riches. The stock of
the country, not being sufficient for the whole accession of business which
such acquisitions present to the different people among whom it is divided,
is applied to those particular branches only which afford the greatest
profit. Part of what had before been employed in other trades, is
necessarily withdrawn from them, and turned into some of the new and more
profitable ones. In all those old trades, therefore, the competition comes
to be Jess than before. The market comes to be less fully supplied with many
different sorts of goods. Their price necessarily rises more or less, and
yields a greater profit to those who deal in them, who can, therefore,
afford to borrow at a higher interest. For some time after the conclusion of
the late war, not only private people of the best credit, but some of the
greatest companies in London, commonly borrowed at five per cent. who,
before that, had not been used to pay more than four, and four and a half
per cent. The great accession both of territory and trade by our
acquisitions in North America and the West Indies, will sufficiently account
for this, without supposing any diminution in the capital stock of the
society. So great an accession of new business to be carried on by the old
stock, must necessarily have diminished the quantity employed in a great
number of particular branches, in which the competition being less, the
profits must have been greater. I shall hereafter have occasion to mention
the reasons which dispose me to believe that the capital stock of Great
Britain was not diminished, even by the enormous expense of the late war.

The diminution of the capital stock of the society, or of the funds destined
for the maintenance of industry, however, as it lowers the wages of labour,
so it raises the profits of stock, and consequently the interest of money.
By the wages of labour being lowered, the owners of what stock remains in
the society can bring their goods at less expense to market than before ;
and less stock being employed in supplying the market than before, they can
sell them dearer. Their goods cost them less, and they get more for them.
Their profits, therefore, being augmented at both ends, can well afford a
large interest. The great fortunes so suddenly and so easily acquired in
Bengal and the other British settlements in the East Indies, may satisfy us,
that as the wages of labour are very low, so the profits of stock are very
high in those ruined countries. The interest of money is proportionably so.
In Bengal, money is frequently lent to the farmers at forty, fifty, and
sixty per cent. and the succeeding crop is mortgaged for the payment. As the
profits which can afford such an interest must eat up almost the whole rent
of the landlord, so such enormous usury must in its turn eat up the greater
part of those profits. Before the fall of the Roman republic, a usury of the
same kind seems to have been common in the provinces, under the ruinous
administration of their proconsuls. The virtuous Brutus lent money in Cyprus
at eight-and-forty per cent. as we learn from the letters of Cicero.

In a country which had acquired that full complement of riches which the
nature of its soil and climate, and its situation with respect to other
countries, allowed it to acquire, which could, therefore, advance no
further, and which was not going backwards, both the wages of labour and the
profits of stock would probably be very low. In a country fully peopled in
proportion to what either its territory could maintain, or its stock employ,
the competition for employment would necessarily be so great as to reduce
the wages of labour to what was barely sufficient to keep up the number of
labourers, and the country being already fully peopled, that number could
never be augmented. In a country fully stocked in proportion to all the
business it had to transact, as great a quantity of stock would be employed
in every particular branch as the nature and extent of the trade would
admit. The competition, therefore, would everywhere be as great, and,
consequently, the ordinary profit as low as possible.

But, perhaps, no country has ever yet arrived at this degree of opulence.
China seems to have been long stationary, and had, probably, long ago
acquired that full complement of riches which is consistent with the nature
of its laws and institutions. But this complement may be much inferior to
what, with other laws and institutions, the nature of its soil, climate, and
situation, might admit of. A country which neglects or despises foreign
commerce, and which admits the vessel of foreign nations into one or two of
its ports only, cannot transact the same quantity of business which it might
do with different laws and institutions. In a country, too, where, though
the rich, or the owners of large capitals, enjoy a good deal of security,
the poor, or the owners of small capitals, enjoy scarce any, but are liable,
under the pretence of justice, to be pillaged and plundered at any time by
the inferior mandarins, the quantity of stock employed in all the different
branches of business transacted within it, can never be equal to what the
nature and extent of that business might admit. In every different branch,
the oppression of the poor must establish the monopoly of the rich, who, by
engrossing the whole trade to themselves, will be able to make very large
profits. Twelve per cent. accordingly, is said to be the common interest of
money in China, and the ordinary profits of stock must be sufficient to
afford this large interest.

A defect in the law may sometimes raise the rate of interest considerably
above what the condition of the country, as to wealth or poverty, would
require. When the law does not enforce the performance of contracts, it puts
all borrowers nearly upon the same footing with bankrupts, or people of
doubtful credit, in better regulated countries. The uncertainty of
recovering his money makes the lender exact the same usurious interest which
is usually required from bankrupts. Among the barbarous nations who overran
the western provinces of the Roman empire, the performance of contracts was
left for many ages to the faith of the contracting parties. The courts of
justice of their kings seldom intermeddled in it. The high rate of interest
which took place in those ancient times, may, perhaps, be partly accounted
for from this cause.

When the law prohibits interest altogether, it does not prevent it. Many
people must borrow, and nobody will lend without such a consideration for
the use of their money as is suitable, not only to what can be made by the
use of it, but to the difficulty and danger of evading the law. The high
rate of interest among all Mahometan nations is accounted for by M.
Montesquieu, not from their poverty, but partly from this, and partly from
the difficulty of recovering the money.

The lowest ordinary rate of profit must always be something more than what
is sufficient to compensate the occasional losses to which every employment
of stock is exposed. It is this surplus only which is neat or clear profit.
What is called gross profit, comprehends frequently not only this surplus,
but what is retained for compensating such extraordinary losses. The
interest which the borrower can afford to pay is in proportion to the clear
profit only. The lowest ordinary rate of interest must, in the same manner,
be something more than sufficient to compensate the occasional losses to
which lending, even with tolerable prudence, is exposed. Were it not, mere
charity or friendship could be the only motives for lending.

In a country which had acquired its full complement of riches, where, in
every particular branch of business, there was the greatest quantity of
stock that could be employed in it, as the ordinary rate of clear profit
would be very small, so the usual market rate of interest which could be
afforded out of it would be so low as to render it impossible for any but
the very wealthiest people to live upon the interest of their money. All
people of small or middling fortunes would be obliged to superintend
themselves the employment of their own stocks. It would be necessary that
almost every man should be a man of business, or engage in some sort of
trade. The province of Holland seems to be approaching near to this state.
It is there unfashionable not to be a man of business. Necessity makes it
usual for almost every man to be so, and custom everywhere regulates
fashion. As it is ridiculous not to dress, so is it, in some measure, not to
be employed like other people. As a man of a civil profession seems awkward
in a camp or a garrison, and is even in some danger of being despised there,
so does an idle man among men of business.

The highest ordinary rate of profit may be such as, in the price of the
greater part of commodities, eats up the whole of what should go to the rent
of the land, and leaves only what is sufficient to pay the labour of
preparing and bringing them to market, according to the lowest rate at which
labour can anywhere be paid, the bare subsistence of the labourer. The
workman must always have been fed in some way or other while he was about
the work, but the landlord may not always have been paid. The profits of the
trade which the servants of the East India Company carry on in Bengal may
not, perhaps, be very far from this rate.

The proportion which the usual market rate of interest ought to bear to the
ordinary rate of clear profit, necessarily varies as profit rises or falls.
Double interest is in Great Britain reckoned what the merchants call a good,
moderate, reasonable profit; terms which, I apprehend, mean no more than a
common and usual profit. In a country where the ordinary rate of clear profit
is eight or ten per cent. it may be reasonable that one half of it should go
to interest, wherever business is carried on with borrowed money. The stock
is at the risk of the borrower, who, as it were, insures it to the lender ;
and four or five per cent. may, in the greater part of trades, be both a
sufficient profit upon the risk of this insurance, and a sufficient
recompence for the trouble of employing the stock. But the proportion
between interest and clear profit might not be the same in countries where
the ordinary rate of profit was either a good deal lower, or a good deal
higher. If it were a good deal lower, one half of it, perhaps, could not be
afforded for interest ; and more might be afforded if it were a good deal
higher.

In countries which are fast advancing to riches, the low rate of profit may,
in the price of many commodities, compensate the high wages of labour, and
enable those countries to sell as cheap as their less thriving neighbours,
among whom the wages of labour may be lower.

In reality, high profits tend much more to raise the price of work than high
wages. If, in the linen manufacture, for example, the wages of the different
working people, the flax-dressers, the spinners, the weavers, etc. should all
of them be advanced twopence a-day, it would be necessary to heighten the
price of a piece of linen only by a number of twopences equal to the number
of people that had been employed about it, multiplied by the number of days
during which they had been so employed. That part of the price of the
commodity which resolved itself into the wages, would, through all the
different stages of the manufacture, rise only in arithmetical proportion to
this rise of wages. But if the profits of all the different employers of
those working people should be raised five per cent. that part of the price
of the commodity which resolved itself into profit would, through all the
different stages of the manufacture, rise in geometrical proportion to this
rise of profit. The employer of the flax dressers would, in selling his
flax, require an additional five per cent. upon the whole value of the
materials and wages which he advanced to his workmen. The employer of the
spinners would require an additional five per cent. both upon the advanced
price of the flax, and upon the wages of the spinners. And the employer of
the weavers would require alike five per cent. both upon the advanced price
of the linen-yarn, and upon the wages of the weavers. In raising the price of
commodities, the rise of wages operates in the same manner as simple
interest does in the accumulation of debt. The rise of profit operates like
compound interest. Our merchants and master manufacturers complain much of
the bad effects of high wages in raising the price, and thereby lessening
the sale of their goods, both at home and abroad. They say nothing
concerning the bad effects of high profits ; they are silent with regard to
the pernicious effects of their own gains; they complain only of those of
other people.
