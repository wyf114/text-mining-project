Some of this information has\\nappeared from time to time in such books as “Graham's Lectures on Chastity ,” “Todd's\\nStudents' Manual,” and a few popular works of a similar kind, which have been of immense\\nservice to the human race in preserving chastity and in reclaiming the unchaste. But all these\\nare now inadequate to the growing demand for more light on these vital topics. It has been\\ntoo much the custo m for everyone, parents included, to shrink from instructing their own\\nchildren, or those entrusted to their care, on these points; consequently , many young people\\nsolely from their ignorance  fall into the direst evils of a sexual nature and are thereby much\\ninjured and sometimes wholly ruined for life's important duties.\\nAn experience of forty years in my professional career has afforded me thousands of\\nopportunities for sympathizing with young men, and young women too, who had\\nunconsciously sunk into these very evils merely for want of an able writer to place this whole\\nsubject truthfully and squarely before them, or for some wise friend to perform the same kind\\noffice verbally . The perusal of a work by Wm. Acto n, M. R. C. S., of London, on “The\\nFunctions and Disorders of the Reproductive Organs in Childhood, Youth, Adult Age, and\\nAdvanced Life,” has, by his purity of sentiments, which have ever been identical with my\\nown, both inspired and emboldened me to write a work of similar import.

This is a law which needs only a little\\nreflection to be accepted as a truth in every particular—in the greatest as well as in the least\\ncreated form. This is more plainly seen in the animal kingdom than in the mineral or\\nvegetable, because its members associa te and finally become conjoined in pairs. Man and\\nwoman, who represent the crown and glory of all created beings, in whom are embodied all\\nthe lower orders, were and are still created to associate in pairs—each created for the other ,\\nthe one to help the other; the two to love and to belong to one another . This principle, fully\\ncarried out, justifies and shows the necessity for the creation of man and woman precisely as\\nthey are, having bodies, parts and passions, will and understanding. It is my intention in the\\nfollowing pages to explain the relatio ns existing between the sexes, for the purpose of\\nshowing that the greatest happiness to the human race will be found in living a life in full\\naccord with these relations. In order that the subject may be fully understood, let us examine\\nthe physical development of man and woman in detail, particularizing the different organs of\\nthe body as they appear in their order of formation, from the very inmost or beginning, to the\\nultimate or end, in their respective natures.\\nEver since the primal creation of man and woman, the human race has been perpetuated\\nby a serie s of births. Children have been conceived in harmony with the natural order of\\nevents, in such matters, and have been born boys and girls. A boy is a boy to all intents and\\npurposes from his very conception, from the very earliest moment of his being; begotten by\\nhis father he is a boy in embryo within  the ovule of his mother . The converse is true of the\\nopposite sex. At this very early age of reproduction the embryo has all the elements of the\\nfuture man or woman, mentally and physically , even before any form becomes apparent; and\\nso small is the human being at the earliest stage of its existence that no mate rial change is\\nobservable between the ovule that conta ins the product of conception and a fully developed\\novule unimpregnated. [A]\\nIt is about  twelve days after conception before the impregnated ovule, which under goes\\nmany changes during this time, makes its escape from the ovary where it became\\nimpregnated and enters one of the Fallopian tubes, thence gradually descending into the\\ncavity of the womb. Here it begins to mature and become fitted for its birth into the outer\\nworld. Soon now the embryo (for such it is called at this early stage) begins to assume form.',\n",
       " \"The first indication of formation that it is possible to discover , even by the help of the\\nmicroscope, consists of an oblong figure, obtuse at one extremity , swollen in the middle,\\nblunt-pointed at the other extremity . The rudimentary embryo is slightly curved forward, is of\\na grayish white color , of a gelatinous consistence, from two to four lines long and weighs one\\nor two grains. A slight depression representing the neck, enables us to distinguish the head;\\nthe body is marked by a swollen centre , but there are as yet no traces of the extremities. So\\nmuch can be observed about the end of the third week after conception.\\nAt about the fifth week the embry o present s more distinctions. The head is very large in\\nproportion to the rest of the body , the eyes are represented by two black spots, and the upper\\nextremities by small protuberances on the sides of the trunk. The embryo at this stage is\\nnearly two-thirds of an inch in length and weighs about fifteen grains. The lower extremities\\nnow begin to appear in the shape of two minute rounded tubercles. Till about this time a\\nstraight artery has been observed to beat with the regularity of the pulse; but now it appears\\ndoubled somewhat into the shape of an adult heart, although as yet it has but one auricle and\\none ventricle. As time advances we find the perfect heart with its two ventricles and two\\nauricles, all developed from the original straight artery . At this period the lungs appear to\\nexist in five or six different lobes and we can barely distinguish the bronchial tubes; about the\\nsame time the ears and face are distinctly outlined, and after awhile the nose is also faintly\\nand imperfectly perceived.\\nAt about the seventh week  a little bony deposit is found in the lower jaw. The kidneys\\nnow begin to be formed, and a little later the genital organs. The embryo averag es one inch in\\nlength.\\nAt two month s the rudiments of the extremities become more prominent. The forearm and\\nhand can be distinguished but not the arm above the elbow; the hand is larger than the\\nforearm, but is not supplied with fingers. The sex cannot yet be determined. The length of the\\nembryo is from one inch and a half to two inches, and it weighs from three to five drachms.\\nThe eyes are discernible, but still unco vered by the rudimentary lids. The nose forms an\\nobtuse eminence, the nostrils are rounded and separated, the mouth is gaping and the\\nepidermis can be distinguished from the true skin.\\nAt ten weeks  the embryo is from one and a half to two and a half inches long, and its\\nweight is from one ounce to an ounce and a half, the eyelids are more developed and descend\\nin front of the eyes; the mouth begins to be closed by the development of the lips. The walls\\nof the chest are more completely formed, so that it is no longer possible to see the movements\\nof the heart. The fingers become distinct and the toes appear as small projections webbed\\ntogether like a frog's foot. At about this period the sexual organs show their development as\\nfollows: On each side of the urinary locality an oblong fold becomes distin guishable; in\\ncourse of progress if these folds rema in separate, a little tubercle forms in the anterior\\ncommissure which becomes the clitori s; the nymphæ develop, the urethra forms between\\nthem, and the female sex is determined. If, on the other hand, these folds unite into a rounded\\nprojection the scrotum is formed, the little tubercle above becomes the penis and hence the\\nmale sex. The testicles forming within the body , descend later into the scrotum , and organs\\nsimilar to them, their counterparts, form  in the female and are called ovaries. These ovaries\\nare found attached to an organ called the womb, and this again is united with the vagina,\\nwhich leads downwards and outwards between the labia majora. [B]\\nAt the end of the third month  the weigh t of the embryo is from three to four ounces and\\nits length from four to five inches, the eyeballs are seen through the lids, the pupils of the\",\n",
       " 'eyes are discernible,  the forehead, nose and lips can be clearly distinguished. The finger nails\\nresemble thin membranous plates, the skin shows more firmness, but is still rosy-hued, thin\\nand transparent. The sex can now be fully determined.\\nAt the end of the fourth month  the product of conception is no longer called an embryo,\\nbut a fœtus. The body is from six to eight inches in length and weighs six or seven ounces. A\\nfew little white hairs are seen scattered over the scalp. The development of the face is still\\nimperfect. The eyes are now closed by their lids, the nostrils are well-formed, the mouth is\\nshut in by the lips and the sex is still more sharply defined. The tongue may be observed far\\nback in the mouth, and the lower part of the face is rounded off by what a little later will be a\\nwell-formed chin. The movements of the fœtus are by this time plainly felt by the mother ,\\nand if born at this time it may live several months.\\nAt the end of the fifth month  the body of the fœtus is from seven to nine inches long and\\nweighs from eight to eleven ounces. The skin has a fairer appearance and more consistence;\\nthe eyes can no longer be distinguished through the lids, owing to the increased  thickness of\\nthe latter. The head,  heart and kidneys are large and well developed. At the end of the sixth\\nmonth  the fœtus is from eleven to twelve and a half inches in length, and weighs about\\nsixteen ounces, more or less. The hair upon the scalp is thicker and longer , the eyes remain\\nclosed, and very delicate hairs may be seen upon the margins of the eye-lids and upon the\\neye-brows. The nails are solid, the scrotum small and empty , the surface of the skin appears\\nwrinkled but the dermis may be distinguished from the epidermis. The liver is large and red,\\nand the gall-bladder contains fluid.\\nAt the end of the seventh month  the length of the fœtus is from twelve and a half to\\nfourteen inches, its weight is about fifty-five ounces, and it is both well defined and well\\nproportioned in all its parts. The bones of the cranium, hitherto quite flat, now appear a little\\narched, and as the process of ossification goes on, the arching increases till the vault is quite\\ncomplete. The brain presents greater firmness, and the eye-lids are opened. The skin is much\\nfirmer and red. The gall-bladder contains bile.\\nAt the end of the eighth month the fœtus seems to thicken up rather than to increase in\\nlength, since it is only from sixteen to eighteen inches long while its weight increases from\\nfour to five pounds. The skin is red, and characterized at this period by a fine downy\\ncovering, over which is spread a quanti ty of thick viscous matter , called the sebaceous coat,\\nwhich has been forming since the latter part of the fifth month. The lower jaw has now\\nbecome as long as the upper one, and in the male the left testicle may be found in the\\nscrotum. Convolutions appear in the brain structure.\\nAt nine months  the anxious time of parturition has arriv ed. The fœtus is from nineteen to\\ntwenty-three inches in length and weighs on an average from six to eight pounds. Children at\\nbirth some times weigh as much as fourteen pounds; but such extremes are very rare. At this\\nperiod the white and grey matter of the brain are distinct, and the convolutions are well\\nmarked; the nails assume a horny consi stence, hair upon the head is more or less abundant,\\nthe testes are in the scrotum, and the entire external genital organs of both male and female\\nare well formed.\\nThe above particulars respecting the development of the human being have been narrated\\nto show that one organ is just as important as another , and that each is really dependent upon\\nthe other; no one could exist without the other and all are to subserve a use. First must be the\\nesse (the inmost) the vital force imparted to the ovule. A little later certain changes take place\\nin the ovule, later still other changes, and finally about the fifteenth day a slight development',\n",
       " 'of the new human being can just be outlined by the help of the microscope, which, as before\\nstated, has form at about the third week after conception. First the vestige of a head and body ,\\na little later the heart and lungs appear lying in the open chest; then the hands are protruded\\nfrom the sides of the trunk, afterwards the forearms, then the arms, all pushed out from the\\nbody; the feet and legs gradually protrude from the lower end of the trunk, and the chest\\ncloses up so that the heart and lungs can no longer be seen; the face, mouth and eyes take\\nform, the external genital organs make their appearance in conjunction with other\\ndevelopments, and in due course of time the boy or girl is born ready  for further\\ndevelopments in childhood, and adolesc ence. When the latter development has been attained,\\nif due care has been taken by all interested parties, we have pure men and pure women fitted\\nto enter upon the privileges and the uses of a wedded life according to the design of our\\nCreator .\\nHow wonderfully and how instructively are all organs in the animal body disposed and\\narranged! In the highest place we find the brain to govern and rule over all below . It is the\\nfirst organ formed and in an orderly life should control all the others. Next in order and\\nimportance are the heart and lungs, which put into motion all other parts and enable the\\nanimal frame to continue in motion. So each and every organ is developed in its proper order ,\\nall to obey the commands of the first and most important—the brain, the seat of the reason\\nand the will. Happy are they of either sex who will govern themselves by a pure enlightened\\nreason and a pure af fectionate will.',\n",

Its cleanliness, its clothing,\\nits temperature and its food are matters for daily observance and care, as also are the\\nlight, sunshine and air which it is to breathe. Opiates, soothing syrups and cordials, are\\nto be strictly avoided as being deleterio us to health; proper sanitary measures usually suffice\\nto render all dosing  unnecessary . Spirituous potions and lotions should be avoided as being\\ncontrary to the laws of hygiene as well as for fear the child may learn to love and to become\\naddicted to their use later in life. Every organ of the body should be carefully protected even\\nat this early age, so that health may reign supreme. Particular care and the utmost solicitude\\nshould be bestowed upon the genital organs. No rubbing or handling of these parts should be\\npermitted under any pretense whateve r—beyond what may be absolutely necessary for\\ncleanliness. The genital organs require just as much watchful care, if not more, as the\\nstomach, the eye, the ear, &c. I regret to say that I have known some fathers to tickle the\\ngenital organs of their infant boys until a complete erection of the little penis ensued, which\\neffect pleases the father as an evidence of a robust boy. The evil effects of such a procedure\\nare too manifest to require dilating upon. Fathers take warning!\\nNurses are known to quiet young children by gently exciting pleasurable sensations about\\nthe genital organs both of males and females—practices which are the most vicious and vice-\\nbegetting that can possibly be invented. Many a young man and young woman has fallen to\\nvery low depths from influences devel oped by these and similar means. Nurses should be\\ncautioned in this matter and carefully watched too, as even  the least suspected may\\n(innocently perhaps) be guilty of this fault to save themselves the trouble of quieting their\\ncharges in a proper way. Early impressions upon these animal passions, as well as those made\\nupon other senses of the young, are very abiding. Mothers be watchful!\\nGreat care should be exercised in the choice of a diaper for infants and the material of\\nwhich it is made. The diaper should fit easily about the organs which it covers and protects,\\nso as not to cause undue heating or friction of the parts; and immediately after a babe has\\nsoiled itself either with urine or from a motion of the bowels, it should be made clean and dry\\nat once to avoid any irritation that would otherwise ensue upon these delica te parts. The\\nmaterial of which the diaper is made should not be stiff or harsh, but very limp, soft and\\npliable; nor should it be thick and bungling. There are great objections to the use of oil-cloth,\\nrubber or other impervious materials as they prevent the escape of perspiration, urine, fecal\\nmatter , etc. As soon as possible, say near the end of the first year, the child should be taught\",\n",
       " 'to use its little chair -commode, thus dispensing with the diaper at an early age. This is much\\nbetter for the sexual organs, is more comfortable for the child and is more healthy; it also\\nfavors a more perfect development of the limbs and joints, the hip joints particularly .',\n",
       " \"CCHAPTER III.\\nC\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00.\\nHILDHOOD  is that portion of life extending from infancy to adolescence, which in\\nboys occurs at the age of fourteen to sixteen years; and in girls at the age of twelve to\\nfourteen years. In very warm climates adolescence is reached some two or three years\\nearlier .\\nMost fortunate the infant who has completed its term of life, thus far, in accord ance with\\nthe strictest rules of Hygiene, or the laws of health.\\n“In a state of health sexual impressions should never affect a child's mind or body . All its\\nvital energy should be employed in constructing the growing frame, in storing up proper\\nexternal impressions and in educating the brain to receive them.” Unfortunatel y this state of\\nhealth is not always  attained. Impressions may be exhibited in these organs at a very early\\nage either from inheritance, from improper handling or from some morbid condition of the\\nchild that could show itself in no other organ of the body and which, like morbid conditions\\nin general, make their appearance somewhere in the mind or body .\\nS\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 P\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 .—Many parents who are most particular  in all other respects, as to the\\nmoral and physical training of their children, imagine there is no need to pay any special\\nattention to the genital organs. This, however , is a grave mistake and needs our careful\\nconsideration. As is well known, some children evince a sexual precocity which may lead to\\nvery serious results. In these it often happens that the sexual instinct arises  long before\\npuberty; such children, if males, manifest an instinctive attraction towards the female sex\\nwhich they show by constantly spying after their nurses, chambermaids, etc.; by seeking as\\nmuch as possible to play with children of the opposite sex and improperly toying with them.\\n[C]“One case is so remarkable that an abstract of it may be instructive: M. D——, between\\nfive and six years of age, was one day in summer in the room of a dressmaker  who lived in\\nthe family; this girl thinking that she might put herself at ease before such a child, threw\\nherself on her bed, almost without clothing. The little D—— had followed all her motions\\nand regarded her figure with a greedy eye. He approached her on the bed, as if to sleep, but\\nsoon became so bold in his behavior that the girl, after having laughed at him for some time\\nwas obliged to put him out of the room. This girl's simple imprudence produced such an\\nimpression on the child that forty years afterwards he had not forgotten a single circumstance\\nconnected with it.”\\nParents are remarkably careless on this point. They allow children to play together for\\nhours at a time without the surveillance of an older person, provided only they are removed\",\n",
       " \"from any danger . It is sufficient to merely draw attention to such a custom as every reflective\\nmind can easily draw the inevitable consequences. Habits are indulged in and marks of\\nfamiliarity shown which should not for an instant be tolerated.\\nC\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00  whic h commonly produce sexual impressions on young children are, allowi ng\\nthem to repose playfully on their belly , to slide down bannisters, to go too long without\\nurinating, constipation or straining at stool, cutaneous affections, and worms. Also,\\nthoughtless acts of elder people which  are very frequently more closely observed than is\\ncommonly supposed . The sliding down bannisters produces a titillation which is agreeable to\\nthe sexual organs. Children of both sexes  will constantly repeat this act until they learn to\\nbecome inveterate masturbators, even at a very early age.\\nAmong boys a disease called priapism  is often developed; this arises from  undue\\nhandling of the parts, or from some morbid state of the child's health. The disorder consists of\\nparoxysms, occurrin g more or less frequently , of violent erections of the penis; these\\nsometimes become very painful and require the attention of a physician. At all events medical\\naid should be sought at once, because some functional derangement is at work which might,\\nif not arrested and cured, give rise to masturbation. Owing to unknown causes  such morbid\\nconditions induce some little boys to pull frequently at the foreskin of the penis until their\\nhealth is seriously impaired; they pine away , lose flesh, and still continue to worry at the\\nforeskin, till death has been known to result. These cases require the most carefu l and skillful\\nconstitutional treatment, until they are cured.\\nSometimes, in other cases, the foreskin becomes inflamed, offensive secretions may form\\nabout the end of the penis, etc. All such disorders should be submitted to a judicious\\nphysician at once, to avoid irritations which might result in a tendency to sexual excitement\\n—a calam ity truly deplorable to the young. The idea which some writers advance—that a\\nlong prepu ce (or foreskin) often proves  an exciting cause of troublesome sensations to the\\nboy, is certainly erroneous. So, too, it is all wrong to state that particular care should be taken\\nto wash under the prepuce. That this objection in regard to washing is true, is proved from the\\nphysical fact that in a large majority of boys the orifice of the foreskin is not sufficiently\\nopened to permit of these washings. And the objection is still further proved by the fact that\\nall these unnatural secretions, offensive odors, sensations, etc., which irritate and worry a boy\\ntogether with all inflammations of these  parts are soon relieved and permanently cured by the\\nproper medicament. Needless laving, handling or rubbing the sexual parts should be avoided\\nas strictly as possi ble. To show how little good such washings really do, even though\\npersisted in, I will mention one out of many similar cases: “In spite of repea ted washings\\nevery day, a fetid smegma was deposited in considerable quantity on the glans, causing a\\ntiresome burning and itching.” All such cases are utterly intractable by any amount of\\nbathing. But the suitable remedy administered internally cures the trouble permanently in a\\nfew weeks and at the same time improves the general tone and health of the individual. This\\nis so because the proper remedy removes the morbific cause which produced that condition\\nof the penis and all concomitant symptoms, at the same time. It must be remembered that the\\ntroubles referred to above come from within, and that they are but developments of internal\\nmorbific causes. In a similar manner , small pox, measles, chicken pox and all eruptive\\ndiseases come out as products from morbific causes within . No sane person ever thinks of\\nwashing of f these appearances with the hope of curing the case!\\nAll our external parts were made just as they should be and they work in harmon y so long\\nas we are perfectly healthy inwardly . Every blemish upon the skin, even to a wart, has a\\ncorresponding morbid influence within, which can be removed by proper treatment. Let it be\",\n",
       " \"remembered then for all coming time that a little boy's penis is never to be meddled or trifled\\nwith, nor his foreskin, nor the parts about the generative organs. All unnatural conditions,\\nappearances or sensations require prompt and proper medical aid. If erections of his little\\npenis occur during sleep, or if he cannot urinate promptly on rising in the morning, because\\nof an erection, let these conditions beget an anxiety for his welfare and at once seek a\\njudicious physician, who will be able to prescribe a medicament to arrest all further\\ndevelopment of sexual precocity—an af fliction so baneful to the young.\\nA little later in life children are liable to ascarides or seat worms, called by some “pin\\nworms.” No applications, purgatives, “vermifuges,” injections or other mechanical means\\nshould ever be empl oyed to remove these, as they are of constitutional origin and should be\\nso treated, until perfectly cured. Removing the worms by irritants or by mechanical means\\ndoes not remove the cause  of their existence or reproduction in the body . The dyscrasia that\\ngives rise to these worms, with the accompanying itching and tickling, is apt to cause a\\nsexual excitement which may prove more disastrous than the original trouble itself. Therefore\\nbe sure that this affection is treated constitutionally; so long as the vital forces work in\\nharmonious order , no abnormal appearances of any kind can come to light, because they do\\nnot exist.\\nFrom the age of nine to fourteen, boys generally acquire very curious notions about\\nsexual affairs and are naturally , from what they hear, desirous of obtaining some idea of\\nsexual congress, a knowledge of wher e babies come from, etc. This curiosity , of course,\\ncauses the mind to dwell much upon sexual subjects. I fully believe that good information\\nwill, by satisfying this curiosity , free the mind to a great extent from sexual thoughts. It is\\nfrom such very thoughts that boys are led to play with their sexual organs in secret, and to\\nhandle them so as to excite pleasurable sensations; erections of the penis are thus produced\\nand finally , by this continual excitation with the hand, the height  of sexual orgasm is reached,\\nejaculation of semen occurs and self-pollution  is the consequence. This act is called\\n“masturbation” and becomes a secret vice of the worst kind !\\nVery frequently and to an alarming extent “masturbation” is taught by older boys, and by\\nyoung men even, in nearly all our colleges, boarding, public and private schools, and by\\ncompanions under the paternal roof. This act is repeated time after time until the degrading\\nand destru ctive (morally and physically so) habit is confirmed. As a result, the boy grows\\nthin, pale, morose and passionate; then weak, indolent and indifferent; his digestion becomes\\nimpaired, his sleep short, disturbed and broken; he sometimes becomes epilepti c or falls into\\na state of marasmus; in any case he is in great danger of being totally ruined forever .\\nThere is a great difference in boys regarding the formation of these habits. While some\\nmay almost insensibly glide into them, others, intuitively as it were, turn away from all such\\ntemptations and banish all thoughts of a sexual nature from their minds at once. This is right.\\nSo long as a boy's mind refuses to harbor such baleful approaches, so long he is safe; but the\\nmoment he heeds them and allows them  to enter his mind, that moment he is in danger and\\nwill most likely fall into bad habits. He must strenuously resist all such thoughts and going to\\nhis father or mother tell them about his trials and temptations and strive to forget them until\\nsuccess crowns his efforts. By persistent efforts, by repeated prayers to the Lord for help, by\\nreading his Bible and good, pure stories, by running into the open air and indulging in some\\nuseful occupation or joyous, healthful play, he will eventually conquer them and thus rise to\\nthe dignity of a true man. Sometimes, too, it may be necessary to consult the physician for\\nhelp. In addition to the instinctive shrink ing which every right minded person generally feels\\nfrom putting ideas of impurity into a child's innocent mind, a parent's pride leads him to hope\",\n",
       " 'that his boy would not indulge in any such mean and disgusting practices. But, bearing in\\nmind the advice of Herbert Spencer—“t hat the aim of discipline should be to produce a self-\\ngoverning  being,” the best advice a parent or guardian can, and ought, to give, is: do not\\nharbor bad thoughts or feelings abou t anything; at once turn them away and think of\\nsomething else, of something good, true and pure. Indulge in no hatred or revengeful feelings\\ntowards others; plot no evil things; always be true to your word, faithful to your duties and\\ncharitable to all. Treat everybody kindly and politely . And further , a child should be taught\\nwhat “chastity” really is, instead of leaving him to find it out as best he may .\\nIt should be clearly explained to him that true chastity requires the shunning of all\\nindecency and foul language; that he should refrain from touching his secret parts except\\nwhen the necessities  of nature require it; that all sexual emotions should be subjugated. When\\nhe grows older every boy should be taught that chastity means continence; and it should be\\nfirmly impressed upon his mind that all lascivious actions are a drain upon his whole system\\nand weaken the powers which the Lord has given him to be employed only in the married\\nstate. These are characteristics of a true man and will help him very much to keep out of\\nsexual dif ficulties which, as we shall see further on, are among the greatest curses of life.\\nThe use of tobacco, wine, coffee or tea by children is well known to be highly injurious.\\nNever allow a child  to use either of these—not even in small quantities. A too common\\npractice in many families is to allow a little wine at dinner “to assist digestion!” Others allow\\ncoffee or tea, “becau se my child is so fond of it.” “The after-effects of all these  is to disturb\\nthe heart, to cause nervousness and irritability , and to weaken the sexua l organs in a marked\\ndegree. Tobacco particularly has this last effect in old and young, besides producing\\nconvulsions, a dulled intellect, etc.” [D]\\nRemember where the brain is and the purposes for which it has been given! Here reside\\nthe knowledge and the power to govern all below it. No matter what the stomach craves or\\nhow stron gly the appetite begs for this or that; no matter how much one may be tempted to\\nsteal, to lie or to swear; no matter how much the sexual organs may lead one to think about or\\nhandle them—here is the great and good brain, the home of the will-power , which says:\\n“Touch not, taste not, handle not.” So long as these commands are listened to and obeyed,\\none is safe. The desire need not and should not control the act—but the rational faculty can\\nand will control, when early taught to do so. The more one is led by this ration al faculty the\\neasier it becomes to follow it, and vice versa .\\nWhat has been said above regarding the danger of little boys falling into bad habits\\napplies with equal force to little girls. Do not forget this. They too may have sexual thoughts,\\nfeelings and curiosity , and care must be taken to keep their minds pure and bodies healthy .\\nThey are also liable to disorders that require prompt and careful attention, such as\\ninflammations , excoriations, itchings and swellings of the genital organs with dischar ges\\nfrom these  parts resembling leucorrhœa . All such conditions lead them to more or less rub\\nand scratc h these parts—which should never be touched—for relief. Pleasurable sensations\\nare experienced and then comes masturbation— a sin chargeable to the parent for not having\\ngiven the matter proper medical attention. “Repeated washings” will no more cure these\\ncases in little girls than, as shown above, will they cure in little boys . All these are but the\\noutcropping of some constitutional affection and should be treated accordingly . No\\napplications or medicated washings of any kind should be allowed. Such exter nal treatment\\nonly palliates the suffering for a little while without removing the disordered vital force that\\ngave origin to its appearance. This is simply repressed and may react upon the child and\\nappear in another form tenfold worse than the first. The passing of urine or fecal matter may',\n",
       " '(in either sex) cause  irritation and excoriation; this is another sign that all is not right in the\\nvital force s and should be mentioned to the physician as a sure index that medical treatment,\\nbut not topical applications, is absolute ly necessary . All abnormal appearances, actions and\\ndiscomforts of the child, whether mental or physical, should be submitted to an experienced\\nand judicious physician. A healthy child should be happy and comfortable in all respects.\\nA very successful plan for keeping children from vice or vicious habits is to see that their\\ntime is fully occupi ed with amusements and duties which interest them. They need a great\\ndeal of harmlessly conducted amuseme nt and—do not strive to “keep them quiet.” Allow\\nlittle boys  and girls to play together , under proper surveillance, and let them be boisterous if\\nthey will; let them romp and run, climb fences, trundle hoops, jump rope, go to dancing\\nschool, participate in military drills, go coasting and skating, take swimming lessons, etc.\\nNo judicious parents will allow a son or daughter to be alone much; to seek to be alone is\\nalways a bad sign and should be careful ly guarded against without its being known that such\\nprecaution is observed. Furnish them liberally with instructive and innocent story books and\\nlet them read aloud to you or to each other. Take them to walk or ride when you go, and strive\\nto make companions of them as much as possible, making whatever sacrifices are necessary\\nto attain this end. Above all, encourage their making confidants of you. Let them  feel that\\nthey can come and talk freely on any subject, no matter what its nature may be. Do this, and\\nyou have thrown around them a bulwar k of defence that will withstand the repeated attacks\\nof hosts of evil spirits. When night comes and they go to bed, let them learn to go to sleep at\\nonce; no play then—they may be read to sleep, but no romping or playing . No strange\\nchildren should be allowed to sleep with yours; make them occupy separate rooms or at least\\nseparate beds; be sure that the sleeping places of your children are sacred to them alone. Nor\\nis it advisable for children to sleep with a grown person of either sex and particu larly not with\\nservants—all for obvious reasons.\\nThe observance of all these precautio ns against influences that might excite sexual\\ndisturbance is most sacred in its character and most needful even in a religious point of view;\\nfor there should be chastity  above all things.',\n",
       " \"ACHAPTER IV .\\nADOLESCENCE OF THE MALE.\\nDOLESCENCE  of the male embraces the period of life from the age of fourteen or\\nsixteen years to the age of twenty-five.\\nAt about the age of fourteen years “the period of youth is distinguished by that advance in\\nthe evolut ion of the generative apparatus in both sexes, and by that acquirement of its power\\nof functional activity , which constitutes the state of Puberty .” At this age the following great\\nchanges take place in the general appearance and deportment of the male: His frame becomes\\nmore angu lar and the masculine proportions more pronounced; increased streng th and greater\\npowers of enduranc e are manifested; the larynx enlar ges and the voice becomes lower in\\npitch as well as rougher and more powerful; new feelings and desires awaken  in the mind.\\nHis depor tment becomes more commanding, his frivolity is less and less apparent, and the\\nboy is lost in the man. If he has been so fortunate as to escape all the danger s and baneful\\ninfluences of childhood, he is manly indeed, and we behold him with an unburdened\\nconscience, bright intellect, frank address and good memory . His spirits are buoyant and his\\ncomplexion clear; every function of his body is well performed, and no fatigue is felt after\\nmoderate exertion. He evinces that elasticity of body , and that happy control of himself and\\nhis feeling s, which are indicative of the robust health and absence of care which should\\naccompany youth. His time is devoted to his studies, duties and amusements; as he feels his\\nstature increase, and his intellect enlar ge, he gladly prepares for his coming struggle with the\\nworld.\\nAll boys may come to this condition with proper training through the period of infancy\\nand childhood; and after arriving at the adolescent age of their existence as they have the\\npower of mind to choose , so also have they the power to refuse . The human race is created\\nabove the animal so that we are something more than mere animals; we are human beings\\nwith human propensities, human passions, human desires and human tastes, which are\\nsubject to the human brain, to the human reason and to the human will—all elevated and\\nennobled by the Divine Will. Man must not let himself down to be govern ed by animal\\npassions; the moment he does that, his higher powers suffer and become weakened, and he\\nbecomes more like an inferior animal; if he persists in this downward course, his lower\\npowers become strengthened until finally they transcend and rule the higher . Then, to all\\nintents and purposes, such a man's head is downwards and the lower part of his body is\\nupwards just where his head ought to be.\\nMan is a human being, yet, like the whole animal kingdom, he has appetites, desires and\\npassions, as it is absolutely necessary that he should have. He has organs corresponding to\",\n",
       " \"these appetites, desires and passions, and it is necessary that he should have them. A proper\\nunderstanding in regard to this matter will convince anyone of the truth of this assertion. Our\\nCreator doeth all things wisely and well, in the most perfect manner possible. Consequently ,\\nman with all his organs, parts and passions is just what he should be when he blossoms into\\nyouth, in the perfection of his adolescence as described above. In fact there could be no other\\nform of creating man, for the Lord alway s creates in the most perfect way possible, according\\nto one harmonious law which He has ordained to govern the creation of all beings.\\nSuch a man is fully prepared to struggle with himself and the world at large. In his\\ndesires, appetites or passions of any kind, he, in his humanity , protected by his rational\\nfaculties and enlightened by the Divin e Oracle of God, unquestionably has the power to\\nchoose between propriety and impropriety , between the right and the wrong, between the\\ngood and the bad. Take any evil into which a member of the human family may fall—the\\nlove of ardent spirit  for instance; he first thinks of it and desires to partake of some. Finally\\nhe takes an opportu nity to gratify his desire, does satisfy it for the time and thinks it very\\nnice. The next craving is a little more intense, and he cannot overcome the temptation quite\\nso easily as he could have done before, and at last he indulges again. So he goes on, step by\\nstep, until he may fall very low. The same thinking, feeling and desiri ng precedes  the\\nadoption of every vicious habit that was ever formed.  Nor will anyone pretend to say that a\\npersistent effort of the will power , at the very outset, when he first perceived the tendencies\\nof his desires to do what he need not do, would not have prevented the evil; no argumentation\\nwill preva il in the face of stubborn facts, and the real facts are all on the side of purity and\\norder .\\nThese very young men or youths, as they progress through adolescence, may become\\ntempted in a variety  of ways, some to the use of ardent spirits or tobacco, others to lie, to\\nsteal, to forge, &c.; but the approach to all these evils is gradual and first comes through the\\nmind. They first think about the action, turn it over and over in their minds until they come to\\ngreatly desire and then, later, to commit the evil which would not have been ultimated if the\\nmind had been persistently set against it in the beginning. This is an indisputable fact.\\nIn this manner many  promising youths, just as they are blossoming into the pride of early\\nmanhood, begin to indulge in sexual thoughts and to allow these thoughts to influence their\\nminds until they commit some of the evils to which perverted and unchaste passions lead\\nthem. If this evil be masturbation, then they are on the direct road to ruin, as will be seen\\ndescribed further on. If it be the commission of sexual intercourse with women , their ruin is\\nstill more certain, and in the latter case they are exposed to one of the worst poisons that can\\npossibly infect the human race. I do not overdraw the picture when I declare that millions of\\nhuman beings die annually from the effects of poison contracted in this way, in some form of\\nsuffering or another; for, by insinuating its effects into and poisoning the whole man, it\\ncomplicates various  disorders and renders them incurable. When gonorrhœa is contracted,\\nalthough frequently suppressed by local treatment in the form of injections, it is never\\nperfectly cured thereby . No; the hidden poison runs on for a life time producing strictures,\\ndysuria, gleet and kindred diseases; finally , in old men, a horrible prostatitis results from\\nwhich the balance of one's life is rendered miserable indeed. If inflammation of the lungs\\nsupervenes, there is often a translation of the virus to these vital organs, causing what is\\ntermed “plastic pneumonia,” where one lobule after another becomes gradually sealed up, till\\nnearly the whole of both lungs becomes impervious to air , and death results from asphyxia.\\nThis horri ble infection sometimes becomes engrafted upon other acute diseases when\\nlingering disorders follow , causing years of misery , and only terminating in death.\",\n",
       " \"If real syphilis, in the form of chancre, should be contracted, and in that form suppressed,\\nwe have buboes often of a malignant type, ulceration of the penis and a loss of some portion\\nof this member . Sometimes the poison attacks the throat, causing most destructive ulcerations\\ntherein; sometimes it seizes upon the nasal bones, resulting in their entire destruction and an\\nawful disfiguration of the face; sometim es it ultimates itself in the ulceration and destruction\\nof other osseous tissues in different portions of the body . Living examples of these facts are\\ntoo frequently witnessed in the streets of any large city. Young men marrying with the\\nslightest taint of this poison in the blood will surely transmit the disease to their children.\\nThousands of abortions transpire every year from this cause alone, the poison being so\\ndestructive as to kill the child in utero, before it is matured  for birth; and even if the child be\\nborn alive, it is liable to break down with the most loathsome disorders of some kind and to\\ndie during dentition; the few that survive this period are short lived and are unhealthy so long\\nas they do live. The very first unchaste connection of a man with a woman may be attended\\nwith a contamination entailing upon him a life of suffering and even death itself. There is no\\nsafety among impure or loose women whether in private homes or in the very best regulated\\nhouses of ill-fame; even in Paris, where, after women have been carefully examined and\\npronounced free from any infec ting condition, the first man who visits one of them, often\\ncarries away a deadly enemy in his blood, which had lurked in concealment beyond the keen\\neye of the inspecto r. A young man, or a man at any age, is in far greater danger amidst\\ncompany of this stamp, than he would be with a clear conscience and pure character in the\\nmidst of the wildest forest, full of all manner of poisonous serpents and wild beasts of every\\ndescription. A knowledge of the above facts should be enough to chill the first impulse and to\\nmake any man who respects his own well-being, turn away and flee from the destruction that\\nawaits him.\\nAs if the above sufferings were not a sufficient penalty for the transgression against the\\nlaw—“Be ye pure,” we find yet another . Coincident with the physical wreck, which syphilis\\nmakes of the man who becomes thoroughly tainted with its poison, comes his moral wreck.\\nHe loses all respect for the truth and all regard for his word; no dependence of any kind can\\nbe placed upon him, and he will not pay his debts or fulfil any moral obligatio n; all because\\nhe began by prostituting his mind more and more until, with deadened consc ience, almost\\nliterally , his head is dependent and his feet uppermost, ruling all the better part of his nature.\\nAnd next come the mental sufferings— and most agonizing they are. Unhappy to the last\\ndegree, he no longer takes pleasure in life, but, wishing to die, finally commits suicide. A\\nsearch in any insane asylum will show that a very large proportion of patients are made up\\nfrom those who masturbate or have syphilis. Stamp out these two evils, or rather curses  of the\\nhuman race, and the supply that feeds our insane asylums, aye and our penit entiaries, too,\\nwill become vastly lessened. Think of it! So many of the inhabitants of our prisons, asylums,\\nand our poor-houses, are composed of men and women who have offended against nature's\\nlaws by violating their own sexual nature. Add to this summary the list of broken-hearted,\\ndeflowered vir gins and unwedded mothers, and you have the picture complete.\\nWhat a contrast with that manliness of character from which he has fallen! Now he is in\\nan insane condition, blaming everyone for having contributed to his many misfortunes and\\nhis fallen condition, whereas he alone is the culprit. No one made him commit the first or any\\nsubsequent evil. He allowed his own mind to yield to the first temptation, and then went on\\nfrom step to step, he alone being responsible for the result Yield not the first point, and all is\\nsafe.\\nThe pride of perfect adolescence, as described a few pages back, is due to purity of\\nthought, to chastity and continence.

       " \"with a true expressio n, makes bright the countenance and erects the form. It gives elasticity to\\nthe step, causes harmony in the tones of the voice, and adds dignity to the carriage and\\ndeportment. The first step in the paths of vice in any form, whether in sexual errors or any\\nother , detracts in the exact degree of the digression from all of the above beautiful and\\nennobling characteristics.\\nWe have spoken in the preceding pages of new feelings and desires being awakened in\\nthe youth after his fourteenth year. This change is wholly due to his approaching  manhood, to\\nthe time when he will be fully prepared to appreciate, to love and protect, guide and support\\nher whom he makes his wife, and to become the father of happy and healthy children. But\\nthis approach to manhood is not due to the development of the genital organs, as some writers\\naffirm, for this would be a reversion of orderly development. The approaching manhood\\ndevelops in full accordance to their uses and importance all the organs belonging to man. As\\nthe well-developed infant has all its organs developed in a condition suitable for its state, and\\nthe child has all its organs in all parts of the body , developed in full accord with its state, so\\nadolescence follows, and every organ must develop accordingly; and in this development a\\nnew impe tus is given to every organ in the body . The whole man awakens to a newness of\\nlife as is seen in the change of his voice,  the spreading out of his frame, the independence and\\ncommand of his bearing, the activity of his brain, the soundness of his judgment, until he\\nbecomes in the fullest sense a rational being. Of course the development of his genital organs\\nkeeps pace with that of his brain; but the brain should lead the way throughout the entire\\ndevelopment of the human race.\\nAt the time of puberty , then, a new and a different sensation springs up in the generative\\norgans, which is in perfect harmony with the uses for which they are intended. We recognize\\nthe use of the hands, the fingers, the feet, the eyes, the ears, the sense of taste, &c., and we\\nuse them accordingly . We should think of the generative organs only in the same light. They\\nare intended for use, for the highest and holiest use of procreating human beings to the end\\nthat they may become angels in heaven. These organs were not made to be abused; but they\\nare abused every time the mind is allow ed to dwell upon them improperly . Every excitation\\nwe allow from lewd thoughts or fancie s, has a debasing and deteriorating effect upon that\\nwell-developed form , upon that conscience so free, and upon that countenance so open and\\nbright, which has been described in the preceding pages.\\nIf the mere thought and excitation arisin g therefrom are injurious to the perfection of the\\nyouth, how much more injurious must be the ultimation of that thought in masturbation, in\\nunlawful sexual intercourse, or in the loss of seminal fluid by other unnatural means.\\nRight here I feel impelled to say something of the\\nDIFFICULTY OF MAINTAINING CHASTITY.\\nI, in connection with many of our best and wisest men who have given the subject a\\nlifetime's most earnest consideration, hold that for a young man whose early education has\\nbeen carefully looked to, and consequently , whose mind has not been debased by vile\\npractices, it is no more impossible mentally , or injurious physically , to preserv e his chastity\\nthan to refrain from yielding to any other of the innumerable temptations with which his life\\nis beset. And every year of voluntary chastity renders the task easier by mere force of habit. I\\nwish to be clearly understood in this matter .\\nSo long as a young man remains chaste  in thought and deed, he will not suffer any bad\\neffects from his continence. It is the semicontinent , the man who know s the right but pursues\",\n",
       " \"the wrong , who suffers! Patients frequently complain that enforced continence  makes them\\nrestless, irritable, unfit for mental application of any sort, &c. Sexual intercourse is then\\nindulged in, and presto: for the time being, what a welcome change. The now unclogged\\nmind grasps with vigor any subject presented to it, the spirits are exuberant and the physical\\nframe buoyant. But, is the trouble cured, is it permanently eradicated from the system? No! In\\na short time the symptoms reappear and the same remedy is again sought. The more the\\nsexual feelings are indulged the more frequent will be their recurrence, and the result need\\nnot be written; every  candid mind can easily see it. To their shame and confusi on be it said,\\nthere are many physicians who, when consulted by their patients for medical  assistance in\\nsuch trials, “deliberately encourage the early indulgence of the passions, on the false and\\nwicked ground that self-restraint is incompatible with health. What abhorrence can be too\\ndeep for a doctrine so destructive, or for the teachers who thus, before the eyes of those\\nwhose youthful ignorance, whose sore natural temptation, rather call for the wisest and\\ntenderest guidance and encouragement, put darkness for light, evil for good, and bitter for\\nsweet.” [E]\\nI declare emphatically that no symptoms of sexual suffering, no matter how feelingly\\ndescribed or cunningly insinuated, shou ld ever lead a physician to prescribe for a young man\\nthat fatal remedy , illicit intercourse. Medically as a physician, morally as a Christian, and\\nsympathizingly as a fellow being, I record a solemn protest against such false treatment. It is\\nbetter for a youth to live a continent life. The strictly chaste suffer comparatively little sexual\\nirritability; but the incontinent, at recurring periods are sure to be troubled in one or other of\\nthe ways spoken of; and the remedy of indulgence, if effective, requires repetition as often as\\nthe inconvenience returns. No! When thus consulted, let the physician prescribe the proper\\nmedicament, if one be necessary; and let him direct a plain, nourishing, non-stimulating diet,\\nphysical exertion of any kind carried to exhaustion, and SELF CONTROL.\\nWould any young man in his senses listen to a physician, who, for lowness of spirits,\\nmental despondency , &c., should tell him to drink plentifully of brandy or eat hasheesh? On\\nthe same principle then let a youth shun the physician, who, for sexual excitement, prescribes\\nsexual indulgence.\\nAgain, such compla ints coming from young men are very often specious, and are mere\\nsubterfuges—overdrawn pictures of their sufferings—which are presented as an excuse for\\nindulging the sensual emotions, instead of manfully and righteously struggling  to overcome\\nthem. And further , “if anyone wishes to really experience the acutest sexual suffering, he can\\nadopt no more certai n method than to be incontinent with the intention of becom ing continent\\nagain, when he has ‘sown his wild oats.’ The agony of breaking off a habit which so rapidly\\nentwines itself with every fibre of the human frame (as sexual indulgence) is such that it\\nwould not be too much to say in the Wise Man's words, ‘None  that go to her retur n again,\\nneither take they hold on the paths of life.’”\\n“The sin, of all, most sure to blight—\\nThe sin, of all, that the soul's light\\nIs soonest lost, extinguished in.”\\nRemember then that sexual suffering comes to the incontinent  man, and that it is far\\neasier , even for the fully developed vigorous adult, to continue in control of these feelings,\\nthan when they have been once excited and indulged.\",\n",
       " \"One singl e impure connection may entail a whole life of syphilitic suffering on the\\nunhappy transgressor . Would this “pay?”\\nNo inducement could persuade me to assume the awful responsibilities of advis ing illicit\\nintercourse. Apart from Christian princi ple, I know that there is no necessity , physiological,\\npathological or any other , that can excuse any physician for saying that the Seventh\\nCommandment may ever be broken. My sentiments on the physiological side of the question\\nare so admirably expressed by Acton, [F] that I will here quote from him.\\n“One argument in favor of incontinen ce deserves special notice, as it purports to be\\nfounded on physiology . I have been consulted by persons who feared, or professed to fear,\\nthat if the organs were not exercised regularly , they would become atrophied, or that in some\\nway impotence might be the result of chastity . This is the assigned reason for committing\\nfornication. There exists no greater  error than this, or one more opposed to physiological\\ntruth. In the first place, I may state that I have, after many years' experience, never seen a\\nsingle instance of atrophy of the generative organs from this cause. I have, it is true, met with\\nthe complaint—but in what class of cases does it occur? It arises in all instances from the\\nexactly opposite cause—abuse: the organs become worn out, and hence arises atrophy .\\nPhysiologically considered, it is not a fact that the power of secreting semen is annihilated in\\nwell-formed adults leading a healthy life and yet remaining continent. The function goes on\\nin the organ always, from puberty to old age. Semen is secreted sometimes slowly , sometimes\\nquickly , and very frequently under the influence of the will. No continent man need be\\ndeterred by this apoc ryphal fear of atrophy of the testes from living a chaste life. It is a device\\nof the unchaste—a lame excuse for their own incontinence, unfounded on any physiological\\nlaw. The testes will take care that their action is not interfered with.”\\nMany and many a time have I heard it regretted and bemoaned, on account of the many\\ntroubles they had seemed to cause, that the sexual organs exist. It is the lewd thoughts and\\nuses to which they are put that causes all this misery , and there is always that “first thought”\\nwhich should not be harbored. Cast away the impure thoughts, rise above them , and one is\\nsafe! Pure thoughts can never  lead to harm.\\nThe generative organs, with their functions and uses, are most closely interwo ven with\\nthe highest destiny and well being of the race physically , mentally and spiritual ly; they are a\\npart of us, without which there would be no men and women, lovers and loved ones, fathers\\nand mothers, brothers and sisters. We must then happily accept the situation as it is, and our\\nbodies, parts and passions as they are; for they are all indispensable, high and holy, when\\nkept in an orderly and chaste condit ion. We only need the above knowledge and its\\napplication to make ourselves as happy  in the enjoyment of these organs as it was designed\\nby our Creator that we should be.\\nTo rise above the sexual temptations that may be more or less experienced by many and\\nperhaps by all, requires an effort of course, and frequently a very great effort; but let it be\\nborne in mind that all temptations to do wrong, require effort to overcome them; and as a\\nrule, the greater the evil we are tempted to commit the greater is the effort needed to\\novercome it. Now , as shown above, since sexual matters are so thoroughly interwoven with\\nthe highest destinies of the human race, physically , mentally and spiritually , there is scarcely\\nany function of higher import, allotted  to any individual, than that assigned to the genital\\norgans. No function more deeply concerns the healthfulness of the body , the clearness and\\nbrilliancy of the intellect, or the purity and sincerity of the soul itself.\",\n",
       " \"Several times in the course of this book I have referred to the term “abuse.” By “abuse,” I\\nmean precisely what Lallemand  so forcibly expresses as follows: “I understa nd by the term\\nabuse, when applied to the organs of generation, any irregular or prematur e exercise of their\\nfunctions; any application of them which cannot have, as its result, the propagation of the\\nspecies. ”\\nLook at the habitual masturbator! See how thin, pale and haggard he appears ; how his\\neyes are sunken; how long and cadaverous is his cast of countenance; how irritable he is and\\nhow sluggish, mentally and physically; how afraid he is to meet the eye of his fellows; feel\\nhis damp and chilling hand, so characteristi c of great vital exhaustion. Taken as a class, how\\nterrible are their lost virility , their miserable night's sleep, their convulsions and their\\nshrunken limbs. They keep by themselves, seeking charm in solitude and are fit companions\\nfor no one; they dare not read their Bible, they cannot commune with good angels nor with\\nthe Lord, our Saviou r. Is not this picture deplorable? It is at the last end of the chain I admit,\\nbut it is reached link after link, one at a time; and the first link was forged when the first\\ntemptation in the mind was first favored and finally yielded to. The above picture is a true\\none and shows how intimately connected are the soul, the mind and the body with this whole\\nsubject. Man in a healthy state need not and should not lose one drop of semina l fluid by his\\nown hand, by nightly emissions or pollutions, or in any way, until he becomes conjoined to a\\nwife of his choice in the holy bonds of matrimony . Every time the seed of his body is lost in a\\ndisorderly or unnatural way, he injures  the finest textures of his brain correspondingly , as\\nwell as the finest and most exalted condition of his mind and soul, because the act proceeds\\nin its incipiency from a willful prostitution of these higher powers.\\nWhen sexual thoughts and temptations  arise in one's mind, even very young  men are\\ncapable of putting them away , urged by the thought that tampering with one's generative\\norgans is wrong. He should intuitively feel that it is something akin to theft, or a crime of\\nsome worse sort, for him to indulge in solitary vice and he should intuitively feel an inward\\nreproach for all such meditations. When one is sorely tempted in these matters, as is often the\\ncase, let him reflect that he was not created to indulge in such pleasures by himself, and that\\nto do so is a crime, a sin against the God of Heaven; that it is his destiny , his privilege and\\none of the uses of his life to share such enjoyments with the wife of his bosom; and that all\\nexcitement or dallying with this part of his nature before marriage only serves to weaken his\\nsexual powers, as well as his mind and body; also, that it mars his sexual uses and will detract\\nfrom his sexual pleasures in the married  life. Sexual indulgence of any sort in a young man is\\na loss, not only to himself but also, prospectively , to that dear girl whom he will some day\\nmake his wife. Such reflections will often drive away the temptation entirely . If they are not\\nsufficient to do so let him read some interesting book that shall take his mind away  from the\\nsubject; or, that failing, let him take exercise, vigorous exercise—pushed to fatigue, if\\nnecessary . If these states of temptation occur in bed at night, let him rise and read, plunge his\\narm into very cold water, or if necessary go forth into the open air and seek relief in a rapid\\nwalk. It is better to go to any amount of trouble and to endure any physical discomfort, than\\nto sacrifice one's chastity , the loss of which can never be replaced.\\nA young man naturally desires and expects chastity of the strictest order in the young\\nwoman of his choic e for a wife. Who would marry a girl, no matter how beautiful or how\\nmany and varied her accomplishments if it were known that she had granted her favors to any\\nother man? And yet, what less has she a perfect  right to require from a youn g man who\\npresumes to pay his addresses to her? This consideration, too, should serve as a restraint to\\nany amorous desires that might infest  a man's mind. It is wonderful how keen are the\",\n",
       " 'perceptions of a pure minded young lady to detect even an approach to licentiousness in the\\nmale. He is abhorrent to her and his very sphere betrays him.\\nWith the facts of the preceding pages, contained in this chapter being known, it does seem\\nas if every man would keep himself pure from all carnal associations and use the utmost care\\nnot to prostitute his mind, that he may approach the nuptial altar as pure in mind and body as\\nhe would have her who is to become the idol of his heart.\\nNow this is all very beautiful in theory and desirable in practice, but is it practical ? Can\\nman so school himself in self denia l as to accomplish this end? Are there not real\\nphysiological facts existing which utterly preclude the possibility of this most desirable\\nresult? Do not, as has been alleged by some writers, the testicles of man secrete semen until\\nthey beco me so surchar ged that emission becomes absolutely necessary , and does not this\\naccumulation actual ly produce such sexual excitement that man feels compelled  to seek relief\\nin some way? I answer, most unhesitatingly , NO! The above questions are all theories and\\nutterly devoid of fact.\\nWould Almighty God command, “Thou shalt not commit adultery ,” and then so create\\nman as to compel him to break his Divine injunction?\\nAbundance of proof is at hand to substantiate this sweeping remark of mine, were this the\\nplace to produce it. Seminal fluid is abundantly secreted and produced only during the height\\nof sexual excitemen t in the male. As Acton remarks: “It is a highly organized fluid requiring\\nthe expenditure of much vital force in its elaboration and its expulsion.” It is secreted from\\nthe blood of his body and the whole man physically , mentally and spiritually  is concerned\\nand represented in its product; consequently the action requires an effort of the whole man,\\nand, if often repeated, the effect is very exhausting to the physical powers, to the mind and to\\nthe brain. Let this be another warning to remain in purity of heart.\\nWe have said in the preceding pages that man, in a healthy state, need not lose a drop of\\nseminal fluid until after marriage. There are many abnormal causes resulting  in what are\\ncalled wet dreams, nightly pollutions,  spermatorrhœa, prostatic emission during stool or\\nurination, also diurnal emissions witho ut erection. These may result from over study , from\\nerrors in diet such as use of coffee, highly seasoned food, wines, spirituous liquors or drugs\\nof various kinds—though perhaps prescribed by a physician. When these troubles arise from\\nconstitutional disord ers, a skillful physic ian must be consulted at once. Errors in diet and the\\ntaking of drugs causing this trouble must of course be discontinued. [G]“Certain medicines—\\nas astringents, purgatives, narcotics, stimulants and diuretics especially—may bring on\\nconditions from which spermatorrhœa may arise.” Among other causes Lallem and refers to\\nthe use of quinine, tobacco and, particularly alcohol . The trouble may also arise from injurie s\\nand many other accidental causes, besides masturbation and venereal excesses.\\nIt is distressing to see what a complete  wreck seminal losses make of those who were\\nonce robust and healthy young men, and what a shock they give to the nervous system. They\\nbecome weak, pale, and feeble in mind, while all that was manly and vigorous has gone out\\nof them. Now which of the two is preferable—the pride of a virtuous youth, or the roué\\nexhausted and worn out by sexual abuses? It demands great strength to becom e either , but\\nreally a much great er effort for the latter; because it requires very great perse verance for a\\nchaste and pure minded man to debase himself by such practices. It depends on the mind\\nwhich is all right before yielding the first point; therefore beware and shun the first step\\ndownward. Strength en the moral courag e and exercise the will power so as always to be able\\nto say , “No,” to whatever temptation the conscience tells you is wrong.',\n",

Unlike the male, the forms which in him are angular, become\\nin her rounded, symmetrical and beautiful, and the characteristic feminine proportions are\\nwell marked; she becomes more gracef ul in her movements, her voice grows sweeter , more\\nmellow , more power ful and capable of registering a higher tone. New feelings and desires are\\nawakened in her mind. Her deportment becomes more commanding and less frivolous, and\\nthe girl is lost in the woman.\\nIf she has been so fortunate as to have escaped all the dangers and baneful influences of\\ninfantile and childho od life, she is womanly indeed, and we behold her with an unburdened\\nconscience, clear intellect, artless and candid address, good memory , buoyant spirits, a\\ncomplexion bright, clear and, as the poet declares, “beautiful exceedingly .” Every function of\\nher body is well performed, and no fatigue is experienced after moderate exertion. She\\nevinces that elasticity of spirit and gracefulness of body , and happy control of her feelings\\nwhich indicate healthfulness of both mind and body . Her whole time is given up to her\\nstudies, duties and amusements; and as she feels her stature increase and her intellect enlar ge,\\nshe gladly prepares for her coming strug gle with the world—though in a manner becoming to\\nher sex. This, too, is no fanciful sketch, but is realized in thousands of cases every year. It is\\none which  parents feel proud to witness in a daughter , and one in which the daughter takes a\\nmodest delight. We have said that every function of her body is well performed. The\\nfunctions of the female body , which in a state of health are perfectly free from pain, are very\\nnumerous and, in the four years from fourteen to eighteen, she accomplishes an amount of\\nphysiological cell change and growth which Nature does not require of a boy in less than\\ntwice that number of years. It is obvious, therefore, that a girl upon whom Nature, for a\\nlimited period and for a definite purpose , imposes so great a physiological task, will not have\\nas much power left for the tasks of school as a boy, of whom Nature requires less at the\\ncorresponding epoch. The functions of circulation, respiration, digestion, perspiration,\\nnutrition and menstruation, though involuntary , are all important, dependent one upon\\nanother , and all develop at the proper time. Puberty is the proper time for the appearance of\\nmenstruation, one of the most important and sacred of her functions. It should not be feared,\\ndreaded or regarded as a nuisance; it forms a part of herself; and she never commands the\\nrespect and forbearance of her friends, or even of her enemies, more than when it is known\\nthat she is “unwell.” It serves in many ways as a blessing to her, rather than an\",\n",
       " \"inconvenience. Let no young girl be alarmed, as, owing to the negligence of her parents or\\nguardians, many are, at the first appearance of this flow of blood from the genital organs. She\\nshould keep more quiet than usual, at these times, until the flow disappears, which it will do\\nin a few days. In a state of health these appearances occur every twenty-eight days and the\\nyoung lady should exercise extreme caution at such times, in avoiding unnece ssary fatigue,\\nexposure to cold, getting wet, suddenly cooling off when heated, etc. One of the reasons why\\nso many suffer at this time is due to the want of proper knowledge and care, also for the want\\nof a proper feeling about the matter . I have known young ladies to be guilty of the almost\\nincredible crime of trying to arrest the flow by plugging up the vagina and by resorting to\\nother means, that they might attend a dancing party or some pleasure excur sion. Such a\\nprocedure is sure to be followed by the direst retribution to the offender . Nature  never allows\\nher laws to be so trifled with. Some experience a deep mortification on account of this\\nfunction; some think it a very great inconvenience and a nuisance—an obstacle to their\\npleasure; others feel unhappy and vexed  about it. In truth, every woman should  consider it a\\nprivilege and should regard menstruatio n as it really is, a blessing from heaven; and, when\\nrightly performed, a help to lend loveliness to her character , beauty to her expression, music\\nto her voice, and gracefulness to her form and movements.\\nMothers or guardians should instruct young girls in good time as to the expected\\nmenstrual function and prepare their minds for its advent. They should also be carefully\\ninstructed in regard to the external use of water—of its attendant danger , lest they chill\\nthemselves sufficien tly to arrest this flow, which should continue uninterrup tedly until the\\nfunction is complete . Too many lives have been sacrificed by suppressing the monthly flux;\\nexternal ablutions should be plentiful, but only sufficient, as in the case of boys, for\\ncleanliness. If menstruation should not become healthfully established at the proper time of\\nage, consult a judicious physician who will see that any abnormal condition, preventing such\\nconsummation, is properly removed. “The principal organs of elimination, common to both\\nsexes, are the bowels, kidneys, lungs and skin. A neglect of their functions is punished in\\neach alike. To woman is intrusted the exclusive management of another process of\\nelimination, viz.: the catamenial function. This, using the blood for its channel of operation,\\nperforms, like the blood, double duty. It is necessary to ovulation, and to the integrity of\\nevery part of the reproductive apparatus; it also serves as a means of elimination for the blood\\nitself. A careless management of this function, at any period of life during its existence, is apt\\nto be followed by consequences that may be serious; but a neglect of it during the epoch of\\ndevelopment, that is, from the age of fourteen to eighteen or twenty , not only produces great\\nevil at the time of the neglect, but leaves a large legacy of evil to the future. The system is\\nthen peculiarly susceptible; and disturba nces of the delicate mechanism we are considering,\\ninduced during the catamenial weeks of that critical age by constrained positions, muscular\\neffort, brain work, and all forms of mental and physical excitement, germinate a host of\\nills.” [H]\\nHere I must be allowed to protest most solemnly against the use of injection s into the\\nvagina for the so-called purpose of cleanliness. Vaginal syringes are constructed and used\\nnow by thousands and the sufferings of the human race are increased thereby ten thousand\\nfold proportionately . The vagina, like all organs supplied with a mucous membrane, is self-\\ncleansing. Water, or any other fluid thrown into this organ, has a tendency to disorder the\\nmucous follicles, to dry up their secretions and thus prevent the efflux of some of Nature's\\nnecessities. From this cause alone there will be a reaction upon the vaginal walls, upon the\\nneck of the uterus and the uterus itself; the ovaries also become disordered; the lungs\\nsympathize as well as the throat and bronchial tubes, producing hoarseness, hacking cough\",\n",
       " \"and a host of troubles following in their train. Nervous headaches of fearful intensity are\\nfrequently produced from this unnatural course of procedure. Moreover , water thrown into\\nthe vagina, to wash  it out, day after day for a considerable time, absolutely produces a\\nleucorrhœa most persistent in character . This is the confession of young ladies to me in\\nmaking inquiry as to the origin of their trouble, and I have found that the dischar ge was\\nunknown to some of them till after the use of these injections. It stands to reason that such\\nunnatural washings  should be followe d by a retribution equal to the error committed,\\nbecause, as before stated, Nature's laws cannot be perverted without a penalty . A girl should\\nnever , under any pretext whatever , resort to such unhallowed means for the cure or\\nalleviation of leucorrhœa, ulceration, or for any disorders that affect these parts. By so doing\\nshe is really formin g a basis for innumerable future ills. If the girl is well, she has none of\\nthese disorders, for they all arise from constitutional derangements. As all must acknowledge,\\nit is a self-evident fact—that, if a woman is well, every part of her must be well also; no one\\norgan can, unaided, get up a disease by itself. In all troubles of this nature, as well as of any\\nother , consult a judicious physician.\\nThere are objections , however , of even a graver nature than those urged above against the\\nuse of such instruments. They often excite sensations in the parts to which they are applied,\\nthat should remain perfectly dormant in the unmarried state. After awhile these sensations,\\nincreasing in frequency and influence, serve to prostitute the mind and the young lady may\\nbecome ruined for life. I am stating facts that can be proved by multitudes of living witnesses\\nto-day in cases and confessions that have come under my own observation. On remonstrating\\nagainst this habit, some remark, “But it feels so nice, doctor!” Of course, ablutions of the\\nexternal  organs are perfectly right and prope r and should be resorted to daily . To the\\nreflecting mind no more need be said about this matter . Those who wish to live in harmony\\nwith the order of their creation and thereby preserve the freshness of health, will not have\\nrecourse to such means as add new derangements to the system.\\nTo preserve feminine charms as the girl develops into womanhood, much depends upon\\nher mental state. She must not allow herself to bear malice towards anyone, must not plot evil\\nor attempt to “pay off others in their own coin,” as it is called, or seek revenge  in any way;\\nbut she must ever cultivate a forgiving disposition, good thoughts and good feelings towards\\neveryone. There is always danger of meeting both rude and lewd girls, and that too in places\\nwhere least expected; they may be found in schools of all kinds and are occasionally met with\\nin the houses of one's own friends. Not very long since a charming young lady wrote me from\\na neighbor ing city, that while sharing a bed with another girl, she experienced a very strange\\nsensation induced by the improper liberties of her bed-fellow; and so persistent were these\\ntroublesome sensations, although occup ying a bed by herself ever after, she thought it proper\\nto seek my advice. Now this was a good and pure-minded girl who might easily have been\\nruined but for her inherent love of chastity; and so our daughters are always in danger of\\nbeing contaminated. A perfectly pure and chaste mind, unsullied by impure thoughts or acts,\\nand cultivated by the exercise of all the Christian virtues, lends enchantmen t to the eye,\\nsweetness of expression to the face, music to the voice, and gracefulness  of carriage.\\nCultivation of merely external manner s will not do; they must spring from the mind and\\nthence they shine throughout the whole, in every fibre and movement of the body . Such an\\none is truly beloved wherever she goes; she has a real affection for her father and mother ,\\nbrothers and sisters; and she is fully prepared to appreciate and love one of the opposite sex\\nwhose purity of life and nobleness of mind fully corresponds to her own.\\nTo retain this charm of excellence will cost her many a trial and her temptations will be\\ninnumerable and very great. But her perceptive faculties are keen, and at the first suspicion of\",\n",
       " \"anything wrong she must have the mora l courage to say: “No! that is not allowable, it is not\\nright,” or, “this is impure and its tendency is to vice.” Whatever the temptation may be, in\\nthought or in deed, let no one persuade  her into wrong-doing—not even her appar ently  best\\nfriend; for it would only be an appearance of friendship if he tempted to anything of a vicious\\nnature. She will be beset with hosts of admirers, some of them pure and having honorable\\nintentions; but (I am sorry to sound the note of warning here,) others will come with the most\\ndishonorable intentions possible, though with an air of sincerity , and apparently as artless as\\ndoves. Study all men long and carefully , keeping them meanwhile at a respec tful distance;\\nnever allow one to sit near with his arm about your waist or to hold your hand  in his; never\\nallow him to kiss you— the vilest of loathsome diseases may be communicated by a kiss viz.:\\nsyphilis . Do not allow any approach or touch beyond what is customary in the best of society\\nat a social gathering. Many a young lady with an angelic form and spotless soul within, full\\nof the best intention s and of the purest character , giving bright promise of a brilliant future,\\nhas been ruined for life by trusting herself alone with some of these apparently wise and\\ngood, yet really vile men.\\nYoung women have not, as a rule, any sexual propensity , or amorous thoughts or feelings.\\nIf they have been properly educated and cared for, they are, before marriage, perfect strangers\\nto any such sensations; and yet any young lady who falls, does so by her own hand and she\\nhas no one else to blame for it. Remember  that the Lord, in the beginning, never suffers\\ntemptations beyond one's strength to overcome. If she falls ultimately , it results from\\nallowing an impure  seed to be planted in the mind at first, which she then nourishes for a\\ntime and only in the end it bears its fruit.\\nAs time passes, a young lady forms an acquaintance with gentlemen, and at length she\\nfavors the addresses of one who is particularly agreeable to her. After this acquaintance has\\nripened into love, and she has become convinced of the purity of his heart, she enjoys being\\nwith him, in sitting by his side, and is unhappy in his absence. When betrothed,  owing to her\\ngreat and pure love for him, she takes pleasure in receiving such marks of affection from him\\nas are shown by a tender father or brother , but nothing more. After marriage, she feels that\\nshe is really his and that he has become a part of herself—that they are no more twain but are\\none flesh. All this has transpired without her hardly suspecting such a quality in herself as an\\namorous affection. Still she more than ever loves him, more than ever desires to be near him\\nuntil finally their union is fully and truly consummated by the marriage act. At no time in her\\nlife does a woman make a greater sacrifice of her feelings than at this time, and she does it\\nsolely for her pure and fervent love for him. This is right and proper , and is in accordance\\nwith the laws of order in the creation of the two sexes in the human, animal and vegetable\\nkingdoms throughout the world.\\nI wish here to have some “Plain Talk,” that the true object of this book may be more fully\\nunderstood and its mission more successfully accomplished. Unless willing to make the\\nabove sacrifice, no woman should ever marry; because she would not then be fulfilling the\\nmarriage covenant. Besides, she would be false to her husband and this falsity might cause\\nhis moral and physical destruction; his health would suffer and his manh ood become\\ndethroned, because her conduct would utterly controvert the immutable laws of nature.\\nNature's laws cannot possibly be set aside without the infliction of a severe  penalty . The\\nhealthy young woman will have no difficulty in preserving her chastity intact, so long as she\\ncultivates that purity of mind to which she is naturally prone. She should never allow herself\\nto read immoral stories or books having in the slightest degree even, such a tendency;\\ntheatrical plays with loose morals should also be avoided, and light, silly novels are very\",\n",
       " 'pernicious to the imaginative mind of the young. On the other hand useful reading stores the\\nmind with high and noble thoughts, whence spring good and useful deeds.\\nUnfortunately there are a variety of morbid conditions to which the female is liable, so\\nthat sexual desires arise in spite of every effort to keep aloof from them—even  though there\\nis not the slightest guilt in mental or bodily transgression. These are owing to disordered\\nconditions of the sexual system, just as other disorderly desires arise, and are often inherited\\n—remember this all parents!—or they may be caused by some morbific influ ences, as are\\nother diseased cond itions of the body . Many a time have I had pure-minded young ladies\\napply to me for medical aid in these matters, confessing that they had impure thoughts which\\nthey knew were wrong, but of which they could not rid themselves. In such cases there are\\nphysical symptoms of some kind that incite these thoughts and feelings. The proper medical\\nand hygienic treatment always restores order in such functional derangements and the sexual\\ndisturbances of the mind disappear . I have repeatedly cured nymphoman ia by curing\\nphysical, or constitu tional symptoms. In one case which came under my care, nymphomania\\nappeared in a married woman in the seventh month of her pregnancy , and so fearfully did her\\nmania rage that it threw her into convul sions. Her physical and sensational symptoms led me\\nto the choice of the medicine that cured her, so that she was happily delivered of a fine,\\nhealthy child at full term and no trace of the disease has ever appeared since. Too often young\\nwomen err and give way to such feelings in resorting to self-abuse  for relief, or to the\\ncaresses of the oppo site sex, when they are ruined forever . It is never safe to temporize or to\\ntamper in this way with such sensations. Women have heads and brains, as well as men, and\\nrational faculties, too. Every digression allowed, only paves the way for others,  with less and\\nless resistance, and more and more ruinous results. Let a judicious physician be consulted at\\nonce in all cases where a morbid condition seems to excite immoral thoughts and sensations.\\nThe effects of self-abuse upon woman, is as disastrous as masturbation upon males. A few\\nhours after its comm ission, or the next day at furthest, she feels languid and dragged out,\\nsleepy , unfit for reading anything solid , or studying, and unfit for social enjoyment with\\nothers; she looks pale and haggard; often she feels giddy , particularly when  rising in the\\nmorning, with many other discomforts too numerous to mention here. And is it true that some\\nyoung ladies, the sweetest and fairest of our race, play with one another in an immodest and\\nindecent way, teaching immorality to the pure and innocent? I fear it is, I know  it is. Such\\nthings need not, must not, and will not be tolerated. This little book will go about in all\\nclasses of society confirming and strengthening the pure in heart in their purity and\\nenlightening the ignorant who will joyfully hail the good news; all will join hands in one\\npopular cry against indecencies and indulgences of an impure nature; and the vilest man even\\nwill be taught to fear and respect the combined world of chaste female influence. So it must\\nbe and eventually will be; but woman, naturally pure and lovely woman! the greatest part of\\nthis work must be done by you.',\n",

One quality: Is\\nshe strictly virtuous? Is she chastity itself in thought, word and deed? If you, young man,\\nhave been the same, if you have held yourself in by “bit and bridle,” as it were,—then, if she\\nreciprocates your love, you are at liberty to propose marriage to her .\\nBefore marriage, a young man takes great pains to make himself attractive , is very\\nattentive and polite, keeps up a genteel appearance and is civility itself, that he may woo and\\nwin the young lady most nearly approa ching his ideal of feminine perfection , and the one\\nmost nearly suited to his tastes and congeniality . After marriage he feels that she is his, that\\nshe has pledged herself to this effect; and the law has so decided; she is his, as he is hers,\\nirrevocably .

Be as watchful as when you were\\nher wooer and even more so. Let nothing induce you to swerve from your duty, to violate\\nyour vow or to betray your trust. But ever be faithful and true.

Heavier responsibilities rest upon you now than before marriage.\\nYour wife must be protected, supported and cared for in every possible way, and you need to\\nbe even more caref ul to retain her love than you were to win it.

Such\\nabsences distress a wife greatly , though her love often restrains any expression of\\ndisapproval.

Through infancy , childhood and adolescence you\\nhave been  watched over most tenderly  and cared for most lovingly; you have been\\nprotected and educated, and have been  made as happy under the paternal roof as\\ncircumstances would  allow; and this very book has been written largely on your account. It\\nhas been the custom from time immemorial, as it always will be, for girls to complete their\\neducation and then to marry . But alas! how very few seem to realize what married life really\\nis and what will be expected in it; what its duties and responsibilities are, or even what leads\\nto marriage. But to the question why do you even think of getting married? The answer is,\\n“Because it is inhere nt in the mind of every true female character . It was ordain ed of God in\\nher creation, spiritually , mentally , and physically—from her inmost being to her complete\\nultimation. It was in the very design of her creation that she should love and be loved, that\\nshe should be sought after by the male sex, and that she should become a wife and mother .”\\nFirst, let us understand what “marriage”  signifies. The word itself has the same meaning\\nas the Latin word conjugium  and repre sents a conjunction or union together . Carried out to its\\nhigher or more interior meaning, marriage signifies the joining of good and truth—the\\n“good” being represented by the woman  and “truth” being represented by the man. Hence it\\ndenotes the spiritual conjunction of minds, and thence of bodies, in contradist inction to the\\nmerely natural conjunction or joining together of bodies only. So, to secure a real marriage,\\nthere must be a spiritual conjunction of minds; and the conjunction of bodies in wedlock is\\nsimply the ultimation, or manifestation of spiritual principles in marriage.\\nThe true reason why girls marry is because they have an innate principle of love for the\\nmale sex; and this love is drawn from the Lord above. Consequently , it is pure, chaste, and\\nwhen fully  developed, very powerful. In connection with this principle comes the desire to be\\nsought after and loved by a man of congenial character for whose dear sake a woman is\\ninduced to leave father and mother , brothers and sisters, to become the wife of him whom she\\ncan claim as her own dear husband. This Heaven-born principle is what leads and induces the\\nfemale to assent to the marriage relatio n. For her own sake, for his sake as well as for the\\nsake of all parties concerned, this step should be taken very carefully and only after mature\\nconsideration. Once  married, there is no escape from its lifelong duties and responsibilities.\\nShe must yield to him whatever the marriage vow allows, that she may become a wife in the\\nfullest sense of the term. Marriage is a sacred relation, instituted by God Himself, and the\\nsexual approach which follows between husband and wife, is a special avowal of their',\n",
       " \"relation to each other; and so often as it is repeated it is a renewal of their obligations to be\\nfaithful to each other . All sexuality is in the order of creation and, coming from the Lord,\\nserves for high and holy purposes. It was never  intended for mere carnal pleasure; as such, it\\nis the profanation and perversion of a great boon to the human race. The man or woman who\\nperverts it must and will, sooner or later , suffer a penalty equal to the transgression.\\nThe husband rightfully expects to find in his wife, as a seal of the marriage covenant, his\\ngreatest possible delight. It should be her greatest delight to give him that pleasure; and if she\\nloves her husband according to her avowal, she will not fail to do this. The feeling, each of\\nthe other's nearness—in thought, word and act, as though each one were intertwined with the\\nother in the most complete union, is a very great delight; even indescribably great. The sexual\\nact itself is really a type of the perfect harmony in which the married pair should dwell\\nthroughout their lives. It teaches a mutual yielding so that the honeymoon, rising so\\nbeautifully and lovingly , may continue to wax lighter and brighter and its fullness be attained\\nin this world only at the dissolution, by a natural death, of a union so orderly and happily\\nformed. It is in the very nature of the male to seek his mate; it is an inborn principle for him\\nto do so, and his health, even his life, certainly his moral life, often depends upon an orderly\\nand lawful indulgence of what this inherent principle demands. The greatest longevity and\\nthe best health are found among fathers and mothers; thereby proving that orderly and well-\\nregulated sexual intercourse is just as necessary to the married couple as are the functional\\ndemands of all other organs of the body . From the foregoing it may be plainly inferred, that,\\nif the wife of a chaste young man who has duly guarded himself from his childhood up, until\\nhe has sought and wedded his mate, fails to reciprocate cheerfully and pleasantly in the seal\\nof connubial affection, she proves a bitter disappointment to him. Not that he is carnal, gross\\nor beastly , no! The principle given him by his Creator and residing in his pure and inmost\\nsoul has been violated by her in whom he placed his life's confidence; she has proved false  to\\nhim in this particular , one upon which their present and eternal welfare so largely depends.\\nYoung ladies about to marry should be taught to understand this matter most fully, in all its\\nbearings. If they pervert marriage in false practices, the love of God, conjugal love, and the\\nlove of infants, the three holiest and noblest inspirations of life, perish togethe r. No woman\\nthen should ever marry without a full knowledge of her duties to her husband, particularly in\\nthe sexual  respect; for without granting this privilege to her husband in full and free accord,\\nthere cannot  be maintained a happy married life.\\nThe duties of marria ge, as a topic, embrace a vast field of thought; and there is so much  to\\nsay thereon, so much advice to tender , so many absolute commands to enjoin, so many\\nwarnings to utter, that it is with difficulty I restrain myself from launching out diffusely in an\\nattempt to give the most important of these. But to so specifically particular ize is not the\\npurpose of this book. Enough is said herein, I trust, to set the reflective mind to thinking\\nseriously on these matters and thereby to awaken the conscience to a full sense of its duties.\\nQuite too many cases have come under my observation where the marriage vow has never\\nbeen consummated or, if consummated at all, in a very begrudging manner , owing to the\\ninsubordination of the wife. Conseque ntly dissatisfaction, unhappiness and frequently a\\npermanent separatio n follows, bringing disgrace upon the family and scandal to their circle of\\nfriends. This is not only wrong, but it is a most unpardonable vice. Sexuality has been\\nordained by God in his wisdom as the means of creation. It exists throughout all nature, in\\nevery tree, plant and shrub, in every animal and insect; in every bird that flies,  in every fish\\nthat swims, in every man and woman. The very best and purest of husbands and wives, all the\\nworld over, indulge in sexuality to their united satisfaction, in full acknowledgment that it is\\nof God and from God. Every wife who is unreasonable or derelict in this duty is untrue to her\",\n",
       " \"husband and commits a sin against the God of Heaven and earth. Since, then, sexuality is so\\nevidently of Divine appointment, it should be committed entirely to him in its ef fects. [I]\\nIf at any time the act prove fruitful and a child be born, it should be considered as a great\\nblessing and gift from God Himself. What is more beautiful than to see a married couple\\nengaged in rearing a new human being destined to become an angel in Heaven! For this\\nindeed is the prime object of sexuality and of the marriage covenant. As has been well said,\\nlife on earth is Heaven's seminary . And yet, so many wives, to their shame be it said, use\\npreventives to conception, thus attemp ting to controvert the order of Nature and Nature's\\nGod; this is one of the greatest crimes of the present age and vengeance will surely be taken\\non every transgressor in this sacred matter . Such practice is secret vice which little by little\\nwears upon the inmost vital principle until the perpetrators of such wrongs suffer untold\\nmisery in their physical nature—often not even suspecting the cause of such suf ferings.\\n“But there is yet another reason, and a very strong moral one, why the wife should not\\nremain childless. There can be no question that the blood of the father mingles with that of\\nthe mothe r through  the medium of the child in utero. (Hence the transmission of blood-\\ndiseases from husba nd to wife.) Hence the indelible impressions made upon a wife by the\\nfather of her offspring—impressions, both mental and physical, which by character or\\nresemblance she often transmits to her children by a second husband. Now , * * * * may not\\nthis account for the similarity of character and identity of tastes, and, indeed, for that\\nwonderful personal resemblance, which sometimes develops between husband and wife? And\\ndoes not this requis ite alone fulfil the Divine interpretation of marriage, that ‘they are no\\nmore twain but one flesh?’” [J]\\nAfter marriage a new order of life is entered upon by the wife, and her family matters\\nshould subordinate all other schemes and projects of her future existence. Her main thought\\nand study should now be, “How can I best fulfil these new duties and responsibilities? First,\\nmy dear husband! how can I be a true help-meet to him? Here we two are to be one, a new\\npunctum saliens , and every act of ours will bear the image of our united lives. No matter\\nwhat may happen, I will be true to my matrimonial vow and to my God; for I am in His\\nhands and my dear husband's.” A married life begun in this way, with such resolutions\\nsincerely and studio usly kept, will secure a life full of happiness and privileges beyond the\\nfondest hope and expectation. When pregnancy occurs, just as soon as the fact be suspected,\\nthe little embryo should be regarded as already a member of the family . Every act of each\\nparent should now be performed in some degree with reference to the forth-c oming infant.\\nThe mother's thoughts particularly should be directed to it as much as possible whilst\\nperforming the uses of life. She should read much that is elevating and ennobling in character\\nas this serves a good purpose in producing a more perfect, more healthy and more brilliant\\nchild. Let her read such books as “Elem ents of Character” by Miss Chandler; “Growth of the\\nMind” by S. Reed; “Sex in Education” by E. H. Clarke, M. D.; also, “Wear and Tear” by\\nS. Weir Mitchell, M. D.; and any other books of like character . Do not forget that the\\neducation of the child begins in uter o.\\nDuring gestation the mother should subsist as far as possible upon fruit, vegetab les and a\\nfarinaceous diet—al ways plain and without spices. Plenty of active exercise is indispensable\\nand the use of a “Health Lift” will be found most beneficial. When the nine months are\\ncompleted, under care of a competent physician, the birth of the child will be accomplished\\nwith but comparativ ely little pain, and its attendant dangers and difficulties will be greatly\\nlessened.\",\n",
       " \"TCHAPTER VIII.\\nM\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 [\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00].\\nHusband and W ife.\\nO preserve the marriage vow inviolate,  the same pure love that brought the two\\ntogether should be cultivated by home uses and home amusements such as readings,\\ngames, conversation, etc. If the wife have needle work, let the husband read or talk to\\nher; if he be a literary man, let her prese nce cheer him on and inspire him to nobler and more\\nrefined productions. What was done during courtship that made time pass so rapidly and so\\npleasantly? Was every topic so discussed and used up that nothing is now left for an exchange\\nof views? Is carnal pleasure to be the only binding tie? Such a life is not very pure and only a\\npoor use can be made of it. Topics of interest to a married pair should be innumerable and\\ntheir pleasures inexhaustible. Home is the soil in which the tree is to grow; and the richer the\\nsoil, the better for the tree, and the more numerous will be the branches, all of them\\nvigorously developi ng buds and leaves , blossoms and fruit, which will be most fragrant,\\nbeautiful and useful. When amusement outside of home is sought let it be, as far as possible,\\nof a nature that both may enjoy it equally .\\nHusband and Wife! He, being of larger mould in every particular , in head, chest, and all\\nthe vital organs, is the provider , the protector , the guardian of his home; he, the masculine, or\\nrepresentative of the Truth, is to lead the way in conducting home or business affairs. She, the\\nfeminine, or representative of the Good,  inclines to the good way continually; and, as married\\npartners, Good and Truth should be married in them. There cannot be a true evil way nor a\\ngood false way; there can only be a true good way and a good true way. So the wife, the\\ngood, must conjoin herself to her husband, the truth, in order that every truth may result in\\ngood; and the husband, the truth, should  seek to be conjoined to the wife, the good, that every\\ngood may become true. In this there is much wisdom: if the husband be truly  wise he will\\nalways be sure that all his projects are tempered with good; while if the wife be truly good,\\nall her doings will be enlightened by truth. As hand in hand they thus go through life's\\nplanning and doing, the husband will always be assisted by his good, the wife; and the wife\\nwill be led on in good by her truth, the husband. By taking this high and holy ground, there\\nwill be experienced pleasure and happiness by the married couple, far transcending all other\\nmodes of life in existence. Then will each and every organ in the body be seen to have a\\nfitness, a place, and a use which could not possibly be dispensed with, because, each and all\\nthese organs have an originating cause in the mental and spiritual parts of mankind, from\\nwhich they proceed and from which they exist. Thus we see how wrong, how frightfully\\nwrong it is to abuse, or pervert the use of, any of these physical organs which are so sacred\\nand so important to the welfare of the human family . “Dishonor the body , the temple of the\",\n",
       " \"soul, and you dishonor the soul.” “If any man defile the temple of God, him will God\\ndestroy .”—I. Cor . 3:17.\\nWhen married, the battle for one unite d and harmonious life really begins. The wife's\\ngreat and supreme love for her husband  personally , will allow many privileges which under\\nother circumstances  her timidity and chastity would refuse. Tenderly and with great\\nconsideration should  these privileges be accepted. For, contrary to the opinion of many men,\\nthere is no sexual passion on the part of the bride that induces her to grant such liberties.\\nThen how exquisitely gentle and how forbearing should be the bridegroom's deportment on\\nsuch occas ions! Sometimes such a shock is administered to her sensibilities that she does not\\nrecover from it for years; and in consequence of this shock, rudely or thoughtlessly\\nadministered, she forms a deeply rooted antipathy against the very act which is the bond and\\nseal of a truly happy married life. These sexual unions serve to bring the marri ed pair into a\\nperfectly harmonious relation to each other . And just as tenderly , lovingly and harmoniously\\nshould they join in each and all the daily uses of life which they are called upon to perform.\\nThe sexual relation is among the most important uses of married life; it vivifies the affections\\nfor each other , as nothing else in this world can, and is a powerful reminder of their mutual\\nobligations to one another and to the community in which they live. Indulgen ce, however ,\\nshould not be too frequent, lest it debilitate the pair and undermine their health. The\\nbridegroom and husband should carefully watch over his bride and wife to see that she is not\\na sufferer and should govern himself accordingly . It is better that these renewed obligations\\nshould be made at stated periods, as man is governed so much by habit. As a rule, once or\\ntwice a week, or in some cases once in two weeks, is sufficient; but once a week will suffice\\nin many cases for healthful purposes. During the menstrual flow there should be an entire\\ncessation of the conjugal act. When pregnancy occurs it is in most cases, more healthful and\\nbetter for the expect ant mother to allow  intercourse at regular times, very gently , throughout\\nher gestation.\\nThe object of marri age is the ultimation of that love which brings the two together and\\nbinds them together , in the procreation and rearing of children for Heaven. This is the only\\ntrue aim and sole object about which every earthly desire, interest and plan of the married\\npair should cluster .\\nAs to the question of child-bearing.  No greater crime in the sight of Heaven exists to-day\\nthan that of perverting the natural uses of marriage. This is done in a great variety of ways,\\nevery one of which is criminal, in whate ver form practised; and none will escape the penalty\\n—no, not one. Nature's laws are inexorable; every transgression thereof is surely punished,\\neven at the climacteric period , if not before. The questions of failin g health, of physical\\ninability , or too frequent conceptions are matters for the investigation, advice and decision of\\nan experienced, judicious and upright physician. They should never be taken  in hand and\\njudged upon by the parties themselves. And to the objection “can't afford to have children;\\nthey cost too much, ” I have faith enough to reply , “Our Heavenly Father neve r sends more\\nmouths than he can feed.” Let each one do his and her duty in life and this cavil falls to the\\nground like water—which, when spilled, cannot be gathered up.\\nGood people everywhere rejoice when they behold a married couple living together in an\\norderly manner and rearing a large family of children. How often is Queen Victoria held up\\nas a pattern of excel lence in this respect: she accepted and acknowledged Prince  Albert as her\\nhusband and gave herself to him as his wife; and so indeed she was in every sense of the\\nterm. Although a Queen, sitting on the pinnacle of power , she did not seek to avoid the pangs,\\nthe dange rs or inconveniences of child-bearing. By her own personal strength her twelve\",\n",
       " \"children were brought forth and her own sensitive fibres and tissues felt the suffering. She\\nnursed, caressed and loved them like a good mother and she was a royal mother ! Other kings\\nand queen s have done  likewise; other husbands and wives, high in power , wealth and fashio n\\nhave done and are still doing the same . And how much the less should we, in the humbler\\nwalks of life, obey the Divine command “Be fruitful and multiply .”\\nIf a husba nd truly loves his wife and if she truly loves him, they will live for each other\\nand in each other , and they will be one; and they will seek to do right in every particular of\\ntheir marital relation. To apply to life the truths advanced above and to realize them, will\\nrequire great effort by the parties in question. This manner of life will not come  of itself; it is\\ntoo good to come without working for. Mutual concessions must be made daily , and several\\ntimes a day; one's own way must frequently be given up, and always when disco vered to be a\\nselfish way, because the mutual good is always to be consulted. Questions of importance\\nshould be discussed  freely and dispas sionately , and a good reason be established before\\nadopting actions that may not lead to proper results. In the marriage co-pa rtnership the\\ninterest in the right and the wrong, the loss and the gain, the lights and the shadows, the\\npleasures and the pains, should be equa lly shared; because they concern one just as much as\\nthe other , and should be equally enjoyed, and equally borne by both.\\nA start is made with loving hearts and this state of affairs must never be allowed to\\ndiminish. The husband should ever be glad to see his wife, and the wife should ever be glad\\nto see her husband. How many husbands never know what reception they will meet with on\\nreturning home after their anxious and exhausting business hours are over for the day; it may\\nbe a happ y or a very unhappy one. How  much it consoles, encourages, lifts up, and rests a\\nman to return to his home after the trying scenes of a day busily spent in providing for the\\nsupport of his family are over, to find his wife affectionate and serene, and all about the\\nhouse brilliant with contentment. Such a wife if she has troubles, and of course she has just as\\nmany troubles as the husband, though of a different kind, and wishes to call the attention of\\nher husban d to them, will do it at a proper time, when she knows it will annoy him the least,\\nand when he will be able to give her the most assistance. She will never try to annoy him; but\\nendeavoring to be a true help-meet will seek in a proper and loving way to get him to be the\\nsame to her. The wife will gain and command the respect of her husband only through kind\\nand loving ways. By her love constantly and judiciously administered she will lead him\\nonward and upward  to higher aspiratio ns and better circumstances in life, throughout their\\ndays of united existence. A scolding, fretting, worrying and selfish wife has ruined for life\\nmany a husband.\\nAll the “self-denial” however , as it is called by some, is not on the wife's side; the\\nhusband too must be forbearing; he must remember on his way home at night that his faithful\\nwife, who has been at home all day, has had trials and disappointments in her domestic\\naffairs; and he must not be disappointed to find domestic arrangements a little disordered, and\\nhis wife somewhat chagrined that, under the circumstances, she really could give him no\\nbetter a reception than he may experience. He must always try to make the best of it and be\\nsatisfied. He must not find fault with the cooking, for instance, but must be perfectly content\\nwith every thing as it is until his well-ma naging wife has had time to overcome her difficulties\\nand troubles.\\nNever find fault with your wife under any circumstances; let your intellect discover a way\\nto better things if need be. A really wise man will never allow a harsh word to escape his lips\\nto a loving wife, or to his harmless children. By so living together a wise husband and a\",\n",

       " \"LCHAPTER IX.\\nTO THE UNFORTUNATE.\\nET no one imagine that, because he or she has committed any of the great errors\\nenumerated in former chapters, there is no hopeful future. Such a conclusion need not,\\nnecessarily , be accepted. In very many cases where there is a will to reform, there is\\nalso a way; and very often a complete cure and restoration to health may be effected.\\nDiseased bones may be made sound; ulcerations healed; sore throats cured; blemishes on the\\nskin remo ved; urina ry difficulties may be dissipated or at least greatly amelio rated; sexual\\ndisorders remedied; impaired eyes much improved and defective vision much benefited if not\\nwholly restored; the auditory apparatus helped if not fully cured; and the distracted mind,\\nwith its fanciful imageries, rendered tranquil and rational.\\nTo accomplish all this the mind  must  lead the way. The brain must assert its supremacy ,\\nand the will-power become absolute. It is only where there is a will, an indomitable will, that\\na way out of these direful difficulties is afforded. Let happen what may, no opposing\\ninfluences should dampen the determination to press forward to reformation; and then,\\nsooner or later , the conquest will be made.\\nTo begin with, when the mind is fully determined to overcome all obstacles or perish in\\nthe attempt, consult a judicious physician as advised in the preface of this book. Lose no time\\nwith quackery in any shape or form. Do not be beguiled by those who promise “a speedy\\ncure.” Speedy cures cannot be made in these cases. Strong determination to improve aided by\\nproper medication can, in bad cases, only restore a healthful condition in from two to three\\nyears. The system requires to be made over anew as it were. The current of life must be\\nturned into new channels. New thoughts and new blood must be made to take the place of\\nwhat were wrong and polluted. This will take time and perseverance; and then,  little by little\\nthe old enemies will be overcome and driven out. But progress for the better must be\\nmeasured only from month to month and even then there may be apparent relapses. Let me\\nhowever asseverate, from my abundance of experience in these cases, that there is ultimately ,\\nafter a reasonable time, every hope of becoming sound and healthy again.\\nMany young persons are rendered quite distracted by the sexual instinct being too strong.\\nIt infests them and goads them on to the commission of further unseemly acts—though\\nsuffering much from past transgressions—which it seems almost impossible to avoid. The\\nsensation haunts and clings to them day and night, in spite of every attempt to rise superior\\nthereto. Sometimes nocturnal pollutions, or “wet dreams,” as they are commonly termed,\\nresult from  these or other causes. There must be some cause for this state of things and a rigid\\nexamination into one's mode of life should ascertain the same. It may come from errors in\",\n",
       " \"diet, in eating or drinking; in the use of highly seasoned food; or the taking of some\\nmedicinal drug substance. It is well known that many drugs have the power of producing\\nsuch a condition. Should any of the above seem to act as causes, a change shou ld be made at\\nonce. The plainest diet and simplest mode of life is always best in sickness or in health.\\nAgain, one may take too little exercise in the open air. If so, an abundance of physical\\nexertion should be made daily , to insure a natural and healthy condition of all organs of the\\nbody . Or, uncomfortable conditions may arise, as they often do, from some morb id condition\\nof the vital forces. If diet and exercise  are insuf ficient, the judicious physician should be\\nconsulted and every symptom or unnatu ral sensation from the crown of the head to the soles\\nof the feet, should be carefully described to him. In all probability he will remedy the trouble,\\nthus restor ing peace and happiness. The generative organs are as liable to be affected by a\\nmorbid state of the vital forces, as are any other organs of the body; and when so affected\\nthey are just as amenable to treatment.\\nThe above  condition  of affairs is not, however , confined to the male sex. Females often\\nsuffer equally and in the same way. Many young persons, of both sexes, have fallen victims\\nto these disorders who could have been cured by proper medical treatme nt. A female\\nsuffering from the ill effects of any bad habit contracted in youth, or from any sexual or\\nvenereal disorder , should seek medical aid with the same promptness and open ness of heart\\nas a male.  To overcome the vicious habit of self-abuse is no trifling matter; it will require the\\npersistent applicatio n of indomitable will, aided by Christianity—by oft repeated appeals to\\nthe Lord for aid, who lends a willing ear and a helping hand to the poor and needy . When\\nreformation is determined upon, it is better to consult a physician at once and act under his\\nadvice. Besides directing the proper diet and plenty of vigorous exercise in the open air, he\\nwill prescribe the proper medicament.\\nCases of real syphilitic poisoning are most serious affections, and everyone should know\\nof the fearful effects  of this poison—ho w searchingly it infests the whole system, and how it\\ncontaminates the blood and every tissue in the body . Such cases, therefore, should not be\\ntrifled with in any way. Advertised nostrums should be particularly avoided . For, if this\\npoison be simply smothered in one's blood instead of being wholly eradicated and cured, it\\nwill be sure to seize upon the offspring and either destroy them before birth or during\\ndentition. The bare fear of such contam ination should be amply sufficient to deter everyone\\nfrom expo sing him- or herself  to the risk. But, having fallen, by all means seek the aid of a\\njudicious physician.  An experience of nearly forty years in the treatment of these cases, in\\nboth sexes, has given me the power to know whereof I speak; and I do decla re that a very\\nlarge percentage of these cases can be cured in a safe manner; and so perfectly  cured too, that\\nthere will be no danger of transmitting the infection to the offspring. I, by no means stand\\nalone in this statement; many other phys icians, after long years of experience assert the same\\ntruth.\\nTherefore, let no one be discouraged, no matter how far he, or she, has strayed from the\\npaths of virtue or how much suffering has been entailed thereby . In connection with the\\nphysician's help, aid yourself. Have courage! Let the invincible will lead on unflinchingly—\\nupheld by pure thoughts, and good actions will surely follow . “Desire is really dangerous\\nonly when it brings  voluptuous pictures incessantly before the imagination. It thus holds a\\nthousand conflicts with virtue which it conquers in the end; it installs itself in the bosom of\\nthe intellig ence of which it becomes the habitual pre-occupation.” Seek therefore for only\\npure thoughts.\",\n",

Those who have led lives of blameless purity , will continue to do so\\nafter readi ng this book; while those who have gone astray will here find every encouragement\\nto set about their reformation at once. If faithful to the teachings recorded in these pages they\\nwill bless the day and the occasion that inspired the writer to put his hand to this work.

       " 'SCHAPTER X.\\nORIGIN OF THE SEX.\\nFrom Whence does the Sex Pr oceed and What Determines It?\\nO much has been written about this matter , and so many foolish, low, and really\\ndebasing theories and speculations have been advanced in relation thereto, that I deem\\nit expedient at this time, and in this place, to put forth the true theory of the\\nreproduction of the sexes, one that can endure the test of the most rigid scientific\\ninvestigation. The only theory upon this subject worthy of notice, must be based upon a\\nprinciple that will hold good and true throughout all animated nature, not only in the animal,\\nbut in the vegetable kingdom as well.\\nThe earth is the common mother of the vegetable world; seeds of all kinds fall into her\\nand she brings forth male and female plants according to the seeds plante d. The earth\\ncertainly does not give the sex to plants  for they come forth according to the life inherent in\\nthe seed; if this life-force be male, the plant must be male; and if the life-force of the seed be\\nfemale, the product must be a female plant. The earth can possibly bring forth no other sex\\nthan that which the life-force of the seed impels.\\nThis is true in the animal creation. Within the female grows the seed given her by the\\nmale, be it male or female, and she can grow none other . In other words the male as is very\\nevident on mature reflection gives the soul or the inmost vital principle, and the female\\nclothes that soul, or gives it a body in which to operate. What else can the male do; what\\noffice does he perform, if it is not strictly this: to impart of his life-giving spirit ! The mother\\nin clothing this germ of life commingles, intertwines, and insinuates her own spirit, at the\\nsame time educating, instructing, and determining its development according to the influence\\nshe imparts to it. So the offspring partakes largely of the nature of both its parents. The\\ndetermination as to whether he begets a male or female depends entirely upon the inmost\\nvital state of the male at the time of giving, although he is unconscious of the fact, so that he\\ncan have no choice and no regulation, as some writers most absurdly claim, in the matter of\\nthe forth-c oming sex. He determines or produces it unconsciously and involuntarily , the\\nmother simply receiving, clothing, and issuing from her body what the father has given her .\\nIt must not be forgotten when exploring  these deep subjects that man is a spiritual being,\\nclothed with a material body , that his spirit is his inmost, and that what proceeds from him in\\nthe generative act has life from his inmost; consequently the life-giving principle of his\\nsemen is from his inmost, which constitutes its life-giving power . This inmost from the male,\\nthe begetting power , is clothed by his seminal fluid for an All-wise purpose; it is not the gross\\nmaterial, the clothing, that begets, but the living power which this material contains, which',\n",
       " \"fructifies, or becomes conjoined, or commingled with the vital force of the ovule of the\\nmother ,[K] so that she can clothe it; and when so conjoined the germ, or seed, is planted  in\\ncongenial soil. Conception has thus really taken place by virtue of this act, and the animal\\nmother proceeds with her reproduction precisely upon the same general principles that\\nmother earth reproduces corn from a single kernel.\\nIt is unive rsally acknowledged that the Lord creates, that we owe all to Him, that He\\ngives us our children, etc., etc. This is true, and it is also true that He makes use of the\\nparents, through whom he operates to this end. By the constant influx of his Divine Love and\\nWisdom He gives us life, and by virtue of this constant influx into the father who begets, the\\nmother's conception becomes doubly sacred. She conceives from her husband, and at the\\nsame insta nt the Lord by virtue of His Divine Power breathes into that conception the breath\\nof life, whereby it becomes a living soul. By the light of this truth we see that it is not the\\nparents who give life to their offspring. They only supply the pure material substances which\\nare organized into the human form by the living and life-giving forces which constantly flow\\nin from the Lord who is life itself and from whom all life constantly emanates.\",\n",

       " \"CHAPTER I.\\nI\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00.\\nN the creation of the world and all that therein is, we should consider it an axiom that\\n“Everything was created for use.” All individual substances, or beings, that come to our\\nnotice bear certain relations to one another, have connection one with another , and are\\ndependent upon and useful to each other; and nothing could possibly exist or subsist without\\nthis co-rel ation: connection with and use to each other . This is a law which needs only a little\\nreflection to be accepted as a truth in every particular—in the greatest as well as in the least\\ncreated form. This is more plainly seen in the animal kingdom than in the mineral or\\nvegetable, because its members associa te and finally become conjoined in pairs. Man and\\nwoman, who represent the crown and glory of all created beings, in whom are embodied all\\nthe lower orders, were and are still created to associate in pairs—each created for the other ,\\nthe one to help the other; the two to love and to belong to one another . This principle, fully\\ncarried out, justifies and shows the necessity for the creation of man and woman precisely as\\nthey are, having bodies, parts and passions, will and understanding. It is my intention in the\\nfollowing pages to explain the relatio ns existing between the sexes, for the purpose of\\nshowing that the greatest happiness to the human race will be found in living a life in full\\naccord with these relations. In order that the subject may be fully understood, let us examine\\nthe physical development of man and woman in detail, particularizing the different organs of\\nthe body as they appear in their order of formation, from the very inmost or beginning, to the\\nultimate or end, in their respective natures.\\nEver since the primal creation of man and woman, the human race has been perpetuated\\nby a serie s of births. Children have been conceived in harmony with the natural order of\\nevents, in such matters, and have been born boys and girls. A boy is a boy to all intents and\\npurposes from his very conception, from the very earliest moment of his being; begotten by\\nhis father he is a boy in embryo within  the ovule of his mother . The converse is true of the\\nopposite sex. At this very early age of reproduction the embryo has all the elements of the\\nfuture man or woman, mentally and physically , even before any form becomes apparent; and\\nso small is the human being at the earliest stage of its existence that no mate rial change is\\nobservable between the ovule that conta ins the product of conception and a fully developed\\novule unimpregnated. [A]\\nIt is about  twelve days after conception before the impregnated ovule, which under goes\\nmany changes during this time, makes its escape from the ovary where it became\\nimpregnated and enters one of the Fallopian tubes, thence gradually descending into the\\ncavity of the womb. Here it begins to mature and become fitted for its birth into the outer\\nworld. Soon now the embryo (for such it is called at this early stage) begins to assume form.The first indication of formation that it is possible to discover , even by the help of the\\nmicroscope, consists of an oblong figure, obtuse at one extremity , swollen in the middle,\\nblunt-pointed at the other extremity . The rudimentary embryo is slightly curved forward, is of\\na grayish white color , of a gelatinous consistence, from two to four lines long and weighs one\\nor two grains. A slight depression representing the neck, enables us to distinguish the head;\\nthe body is marked by a swollen centre , but there are as yet no traces of the extremities. So\\nmuch can be observed about the end of the third week after conception.\\nAt about the fifth week the embry o present s more distinctions. The head is very large in\\nproportion to the rest of the body , the eyes are represented by two black spots, and the upper\\nextremities by small protuberances on the sides of the trunk. The embryo at this stage is\\nnearly two-thirds of an inch in length and weighs about fifteen grains. The lower extremities\\nnow begin to appear in the shape of two minute rounded tubercles. Till about this time a\\nstraight artery has been observed to beat with the regularity of the pulse; but now it appears\\ndoubled somewhat into the shape of an adult heart, although as yet it has but one auricle and\\none ventricle. As time advances we find the perfect heart with its two ventricles and two\\nauricles, all developed from the original straight artery . At this period the lungs appear to\\nexist in five or six different lobes and we can barely distinguish the bronchial tubes; about the\\nsame time the ears and face are distinctly outlined, and after awhile the nose is also faintly\\nand imperfectly perceived.\\nAt about the seventh week  a little bony deposit is found in the lower jaw. The kidneys\\nnow begin to be formed, and a little later the genital organs. The embryo averag es one inch in\\nlength.\\nAt two month s the rudiments of the extremities become more prominent. The forearm and\\nhand can be distinguished but not the arm above the elbow; the hand is larger than the\\nforearm, but is not supplied with fingers. The sex cannot yet be determined. The length of the\\nembryo is from one inch and a half to two inches, and it weighs from three to five drachms.\\nThe eyes are discernible, but still unco vered by the rudimentary lids. The nose forms an\\nobtuse eminence, the nostrils are rounded and separated, the mouth is gaping and the\\nepidermis can be distinguished from the true skin.\\nAt ten weeks  the embryo is from one and a half to two and a half inches long, and its\\nweight is from one ounce to an ounce and a half, the eyelids are more developed and descend\\nin front of the eyes; the mouth begins to be closed by the development of the lips. The walls\\nof the chest are more completely formed, so that it is no longer possible to see the movements\\nof the heart. The fingers become distinct and the toes appear as small projections webbed\\ntogether like a frog's foot. At about this period the sexual organs show their development as\\nfollows: On each side of the urinary locality an oblong fold becomes distin guishable; in\\ncourse of progress if these folds rema in separate, a little tubercle forms in the anterior\\ncommissure which becomes the clitori s; the nymphæ develop, the urethra forms between\\nthem, and the female sex is determined. If, on the other hand, these folds unite into a rounded\\nprojection the scrotum is formed, the little tubercle above becomes the penis and hence the\\nmale sex. The testicles forming within the body , descend later into the scrotum , and organs\\nsimilar to them, their counterparts, form  in the female and are called ovaries. These ovaries\\nare found attached to an organ called the womb, and this again is united with the vagina,\\nwhich leads downwards and outwards between the labia majora. [B]\\nAt the end of the third month  the weigh t of the embryo is from three to four ounces and\\nits length from four to five inches, the eyeballs are seen through the lids, the pupils of theeyes are discernible,  the forehead, nose and lips can be clearly distinguished. The finger nails\\nresemble thin membranous plates, the skin shows more firmness, but is still rosy-hued, thin\\nand transparent. The sex can now be fully determined.\\nAt the end of the fourth month  the product of conception is no longer called an embryo,\\nbut a fœtus. The body is from six to eight inches in length and weighs six or seven ounces. A\\nfew little white hairs are seen scattered over the scalp. The development of the face is still\\nimperfect. The eyes are now closed by their lids, the nostrils are well-formed, the mouth is\\nshut in by the lips and the sex is still more sharply defined. The tongue may be observed far\\nback in the mouth, and the lower part of the face is rounded off by what a little later will be a\\nwell-formed chin. The movements of the fœtus are by this time plainly felt by the mother ,\\nand if born at this time it may live several months.\\nAt the end of the fifth month  the body of the fœtus is from seven to nine inches long and\\nweighs from eight to eleven ounces. The skin has a fairer appearance and more consistence;\\nthe eyes can no longer be distinguished through the lids, owing to the increased  thickness of\\nthe latter. The head,  heart and kidneys are large and well developed. At the end of the sixth\\nmonth  the fœtus is from eleven to twelve and a half inches in length, and weighs about\\nsixteen ounces, more or less. The hair upon the scalp is thicker and longer , the eyes remain\\nclosed, and very delicate hairs may be seen upon the margins of the eye-lids and upon the\\neye-brows. The nails are solid, the scrotum small and empty , the surface of the skin appears\\nwrinkled but the dermis may be distinguished from the epidermis. The liver is large and red,\\nand the gall-bladder contains fluid.\\nAt the end of the seventh month  the length of the fœtus is from twelve and a half to\\nfourteen inches, its weight is about fifty-five ounces, and it is both well defined and well\\nproportioned in all its parts. The bones of the cranium, hitherto quite flat, now appear a little\\narched, and as the process of ossification goes on, the arching increases till the vault is quite\\ncomplete. The brain presents greater firmness, and the eye-lids are opened. The skin is much\\nfirmer and red. The gall-bladder contains bile.\\nAt the end of the eighth month the fœtus seems to thicken up rather than to increase in\\nlength, since it is only from sixteen to eighteen inches long while its weight increases from\\nfour to five pounds. The skin is red, and characterized at this period by a fine downy\\ncovering, over which is spread a quanti ty of thick viscous matter , called the sebaceous coat,\\nwhich has been forming since the latter part of the fifth month. The lower jaw has now\\nbecome as long as the upper one, and in the male the left testicle may be found in the\\nscrotum. Convolutions appear in the brain structure.\\nAt nine months  the anxious time of parturition has arriv ed. The fœtus is from nineteen to\\ntwenty-three inches in length and weighs on an average from six to eight pounds. Children at\\nbirth some times weigh as much as fourteen pounds; but such extremes are very rare. At this\\nperiod the white and grey matter of the brain are distinct, and the convolutions are well\\nmarked; the nails assume a horny consi stence, hair upon the head is more or less abundant,\\nthe testes are in the scrotum, and the entire external genital organs of both male and female\\nare well formed.\\nThe above particulars respecting the development of the human being have been narrated\\nto show that one organ is just as important as another , and that each is really dependent upon\\nthe other; no one could exist without the other and all are to subserve a use. First must be the\\nesse (the inmost) the vital force imparted to the ovule. A little later certain changes take place\\nin the ovule, later still other changes, and finally about the fifteenth day a slight developmentof the new human being can just be outlined by the help of the microscope, which, as before\\nstated, has form at about the third week after conception. First the vestige of a head and body ,\\na little later the heart and lungs appear lying in the open chest; then the hands are protruded\\nfrom the sides of the trunk, afterwards the forearms, then the arms, all pushed out from the\\nbody; the feet and legs gradually protrude from the lower end of the trunk, and the chest\\ncloses up so that the heart and lungs can no longer be seen; the face, mouth and eyes take\\nform, the external genital organs make their appearance in conjunction with other\\ndevelopments, and in due course of time the boy or girl is born ready  for further\\ndevelopments in childhood, and adolesc ence. When the latter development has been attained,\\nif due care has been taken by all interested parties, we have pure men and pure women fitted\\nto enter upon the privileges and the uses of a wedded life according to the design of our\\nCreator .\\nHow wonderfully and how instructively are all organs in the animal body disposed and\\narranged! In the highest place we find the brain to govern and rule over all below . It is the\\nfirst organ formed and in an orderly life should control all the others. Next in order and\\nimportance are the heart and lungs, which put into motion all other parts and enable the\\nanimal frame to continue in motion. So each and every organ is developed in its proper order ,\\nall to obey the commands of the first and most important—the brain, the seat of the reason\\nand the will. Happy are they of either sex who will govern themselves by a pure enlightened\\nreason and a pure af fectionate will.T\",\n",
       " \"CHAPTER II.\\nT\\x00\\x00 I\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00.\\nEmbracing the First Y ear of the Child's Life.\\nHE battle of life really begins as soon as the child is born. Its cleanliness, its clothing,\\nits temperature and its food are matters for daily observance and care, as also are the\\nlight, sunshine and air which it is to breathe. Opiates, soothing syrups and cordials, are\\nto be strictly avoided as being deleterio us to health; proper sanitary measures usually suffice\\nto render all dosing  unnecessary . Spirituous potions and lotions should be avoided as being\\ncontrary to the laws of hygiene as well as for fear the child may learn to love and to become\\naddicted to their use later in life. Every organ of the body should be carefully protected even\\nat this early age, so that health may reign supreme. Particular care and the utmost solicitude\\nshould be bestowed upon the genital organs. No rubbing or handling of these parts should be\\npermitted under any pretense whateve r—beyond what may be absolutely necessary for\\ncleanliness. The genital organs require just as much watchful care, if not more, as the\\nstomach, the eye, the ear, &c. I regret to say that I have known some fathers to tickle the\\ngenital organs of their infant boys until a complete erection of the little penis ensued, which\\neffect pleases the father as an evidence of a robust boy. The evil effects of such a procedure\\nare too manifest to require dilating upon. Fathers take warning!\\nNurses are known to quiet young children by gently exciting pleasurable sensations about\\nthe genital organs both of males and females—practices which are the most vicious and vice-\\nbegetting that can possibly be invented. Many a young man and young woman has fallen to\\nvery low depths from influences devel oped by these and similar means. Nurses should be\\ncautioned in this matter and carefully watched too, as even  the least suspected may\\n(innocently perhaps) be guilty of this fault to save themselves the trouble of quieting their\\ncharges in a proper way. Early impressions upon these animal passions, as well as those made\\nupon other senses of the young, are very abiding. Mothers be watchful!\\nGreat care should be exercised in the choice of a diaper for infants and the material of\\nwhich it is made. The diaper should fit easily about the organs which it covers and protects,\\nso as not to cause undue heating or friction of the parts; and immediately after a babe has\\nsoiled itself either with urine or from a motion of the bowels, it should be made clean and dry\\nat once to avoid any irritation that would otherwise ensue upon these delica te parts. The\\nmaterial of which the diaper is made should not be stiff or harsh, but very limp, soft and\\npliable; nor should it be thick and bungling. There are great objections to the use of oil-cloth,\\nrubber or other impervious materials as they prevent the escape of perspiration, urine, fecal\\nmatter , etc. As soon as possible, say near the end of the first year, the child should be taughtto use its little chair -commode, thus dispensing with the diaper at an early age. This is much\\nbetter for the sexual organs, is more comfortable for the child and is more healthy; it also\\nfavors a more perfect development of the limbs and joints, the hip joints particularly .C\",\n",
       " \"CHAPTER III.\\nC\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00.\\nHILDHOOD  is that portion of life extending from infancy to adolescence, which in\\nboys occurs at the age of fourteen to sixteen years; and in girls at the age of twelve to\\nfourteen years. In very warm climates adolescence is reached some two or three years\\nearlier .\\nMost fortunate the infant who has completed its term of life, thus far, in accord ance with\\nthe strictest rules of Hygiene, or the laws of health.\\n“In a state of health sexual impressions should never affect a child's mind or body . All its\\nvital energy should be employed in constructing the growing frame, in storing up proper\\nexternal impressions and in educating the brain to receive them.” Unfortunatel y this state of\\nhealth is not always  attained. Impressions may be exhibited in these organs at a very early\\nage either from inheritance, from improper handling or from some morbid condition of the\\nchild that could show itself in no other organ of the body and which, like morbid conditions\\nin general, make their appearance somewhere in the mind or body .\\nS\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 P\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 .—Many parents who are most particular  in all other respects, as to the\\nmoral and physical training of their children, imagine there is no need to pay any special\\nattention to the genital organs. This, however , is a grave mistake and needs our careful\\nconsideration. As is well known, some children evince a sexual precocity which may lead to\\nvery serious results. In these it often happens that the sexual instinct arises  long before\\npuberty; such children, if males, manifest an instinctive attraction towards the female sex\\nwhich they show by constantly spying after their nurses, chambermaids, etc.; by seeking as\\nmuch as possible to play with children of the opposite sex and improperly toying with them.\\n[C]“One case is so remarkable that an abstract of it may be instructive: M. D——, between\\nfive and six years of age, was one day in summer in the room of a dressmaker  who lived in\\nthe family; this girl thinking that she might put herself at ease before such a child, threw\\nherself on her bed, almost without clothing. The little D—— had followed all her motions\\nand regarded her figure with a greedy eye. He approached her on the bed, as if to sleep, but\\nsoon became so bold in his behavior that the girl, after having laughed at him for some time\\nwas obliged to put him out of the room. This girl's simple imprudence produced such an\\nimpression on the child that forty years afterwards he had not forgotten a single circumstance\\nconnected with it.”\\nParents are remarkably careless on this point. They allow children to play together for\\nhours at a time without the surveillance of an older person, provided only they are removedfrom any danger . It is sufficient to merely draw attention to such a custom as every reflective\\nmind can easily draw the inevitable consequences. Habits are indulged in and marks of\\nfamiliarity shown which should not for an instant be tolerated.\\nC\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00  whic h commonly produce sexual impressions on young children are, allowi ng\\nthem to repose playfully on their belly , to slide down bannisters, to go too long without\\nurinating, constipation or straining at stool, cutaneous affections, and worms. Also,\\nthoughtless acts of elder people which  are very frequently more closely observed than is\\ncommonly supposed . The sliding down bannisters produces a titillation which is agreeable to\\nthe sexual organs. Children of both sexes  will constantly repeat this act until they learn to\\nbecome inveterate masturbators, even at a very early age.\\nAmong boys a disease called priapism  is often developed; this arises from  undue\\nhandling of the parts, or from some morbid state of the child's health. The disorder consists of\\nparoxysms, occurrin g more or less frequently , of violent erections of the penis; these\\nsometimes become very painful and require the attention of a physician. At all events medical\\naid should be sought at once, because some functional derangement is at work which might,\\nif not arrested and cured, give rise to masturbation. Owing to unknown causes  such morbid\\nconditions induce some little boys to pull frequently at the foreskin of the penis until their\\nhealth is seriously impaired; they pine away , lose flesh, and still continue to worry at the\\nforeskin, till death has been known to result. These cases require the most carefu l and skillful\\nconstitutional treatment, until they are cured.\\nSometimes, in other cases, the foreskin becomes inflamed, offensive secretions may form\\nabout the end of the penis, etc. All such disorders should be submitted to a judicious\\nphysician at once, to avoid irritations which might result in a tendency to sexual excitement\\n—a calam ity truly deplorable to the young. The idea which some writers advance—that a\\nlong prepu ce (or foreskin) often proves  an exciting cause of troublesome sensations to the\\nboy, is certainly erroneous. So, too, it is all wrong to state that particular care should be taken\\nto wash under the prepuce. That this objection in regard to washing is true, is proved from the\\nphysical fact that in a large majority of boys the orifice of the foreskin is not sufficiently\\nopened to permit of these washings. And the objection is still further proved by the fact that\\nall these unnatural secretions, offensive odors, sensations, etc., which irritate and worry a boy\\ntogether with all inflammations of these  parts are soon relieved and permanently cured by the\\nproper medicament. Needless laving, handling or rubbing the sexual parts should be avoided\\nas strictly as possi ble. To show how little good such washings really do, even though\\npersisted in, I will mention one out of many similar cases: “In spite of repea ted washings\\nevery day, a fetid smegma was deposited in considerable quantity on the glans, causing a\\ntiresome burning and itching.” All such cases are utterly intractable by any amount of\\nbathing. But the suitable remedy administered internally cures the trouble permanently in a\\nfew weeks and at the same time improves the general tone and health of the individual. This\\nis so because the proper remedy removes the morbific cause which produced that condition\\nof the penis and all concomitant symptoms, at the same time. It must be remembered that the\\ntroubles referred to above come from within, and that they are but developments of internal\\nmorbific causes. In a similar manner , small pox, measles, chicken pox and all eruptive\\ndiseases come out as products from morbific causes within . No sane person ever thinks of\\nwashing of f these appearances with the hope of curing the case!\\nAll our external parts were made just as they should be and they work in harmon y so long\\nas we are perfectly healthy inwardly . Every blemish upon the skin, even to a wart, has a\\ncorresponding morbid influence within, which can be removed by proper treatment. Let it beremembered then for all coming time that a little boy's penis is never to be meddled or trifled\\nwith, nor his foreskin, nor the parts about the generative organs. All unnatural conditions,\\nappearances or sensations require prompt and proper medical aid. If erections of his little\\npenis occur during sleep, or if he cannot urinate promptly on rising in the morning, because\\nof an erection, let these conditions beget an anxiety for his welfare and at once seek a\\njudicious physician, who will be able to prescribe a medicament to arrest all further\\ndevelopment of sexual precocity—an af fliction so baneful to the young.\\nA little later in life children are liable to ascarides or seat worms, called by some “pin\\nworms.” No applications, purgatives, “vermifuges,” injections or other mechanical means\\nshould ever be empl oyed to remove these, as they are of constitutional origin and should be\\nso treated, until perfectly cured. Removing the worms by irritants or by mechanical means\\ndoes not remove the cause  of their existence or reproduction in the body . The dyscrasia that\\ngives rise to these worms, with the accompanying itching and tickling, is apt to cause a\\nsexual excitement which may prove more disastrous than the original trouble itself. Therefore\\nbe sure that this affection is treated constitutionally; so long as the vital forces work in\\nharmonious order , no abnormal appearances of any kind can come to light, because they do\\nnot exist.\\nFrom the age of nine to fourteen, boys generally acquire very curious notions about\\nsexual affairs and are naturally , from what they hear, desirous of obtaining some idea of\\nsexual congress, a knowledge of wher e babies come from, etc. This curiosity , of course,\\ncauses the mind to dwell much upon sexual subjects. I fully believe that good information\\nwill, by satisfying this curiosity , free the mind to a great extent from sexual thoughts. It is\\nfrom such very thoughts that boys are led to play with their sexual organs in secret, and to\\nhandle them so as to excite pleasurable sensations; erections of the penis are thus produced\\nand finally , by this continual excitation with the hand, the height  of sexual orgasm is reached,\\nejaculation of semen occurs and self-pollution  is the consequence. This act is called\\n“masturbation” and becomes a secret vice of the worst kind !\\nVery frequently and to an alarming extent “masturbation” is taught by older boys, and by\\nyoung men even, in nearly all our colleges, boarding, public and private schools, and by\\ncompanions under the paternal roof. This act is repeated time after time until the degrading\\nand destru ctive (morally and physically so) habit is confirmed. As a result, the boy grows\\nthin, pale, morose and passionate; then weak, indolent and indifferent; his digestion becomes\\nimpaired, his sleep short, disturbed and broken; he sometimes becomes epilepti c or falls into\\na state of marasmus; in any case he is in great danger of being totally ruined forever .\\nThere is a great difference in boys regarding the formation of these habits. While some\\nmay almost insensibly glide into them, others, intuitively as it were, turn away from all such\\ntemptations and banish all thoughts of a sexual nature from their minds at once. This is right.\\nSo long as a boy's mind refuses to harbor such baleful approaches, so long he is safe; but the\\nmoment he heeds them and allows them  to enter his mind, that moment he is in danger and\\nwill most likely fall into bad habits. He must strenuously resist all such thoughts and going to\\nhis father or mother tell them about his trials and temptations and strive to forget them until\\nsuccess crowns his efforts. By persistent efforts, by repeated prayers to the Lord for help, by\\nreading his Bible and good, pure stories, by running into the open air and indulging in some\\nuseful occupation or joyous, healthful play, he will eventually conquer them and thus rise to\\nthe dignity of a true man. Sometimes, too, it may be necessary to consult the physician for\\nhelp. In addition to the instinctive shrink ing which every right minded person generally feels\\nfrom putting ideas of impurity into a child's innocent mind, a parent's pride leads him to hopethat his boy would not indulge in any such mean and disgusting practices. But, bearing in\\nmind the advice of Herbert Spencer—“t hat the aim of discipline should be to produce a self-\\ngoverning  being,” the best advice a parent or guardian can, and ought, to give, is: do not\\nharbor bad thoughts or feelings abou t anything; at once turn them away and think of\\nsomething else, of something good, true and pure. Indulge in no hatred or revengeful feelings\\ntowards others; plot no evil things; always be true to your word, faithful to your duties and\\ncharitable to all. Treat everybody kindly and politely . And further , a child should be taught\\nwhat “chastity” really is, instead of leaving him to find it out as best he may .\\nIt should be clearly explained to him that true chastity requires the shunning of all\\nindecency and foul language; that he should refrain from touching his secret parts except\\nwhen the necessities  of nature require it; that all sexual emotions should be subjugated. When\\nhe grows older every boy should be taught that chastity means continence; and it should be\\nfirmly impressed upon his mind that all lascivious actions are a drain upon his whole system\\nand weaken the powers which the Lord has given him to be employed only in the married\\nstate. These are characteristics of a true man and will help him very much to keep out of\\nsexual dif ficulties which, as we shall see further on, are among the greatest curses of life.\\nThe use of tobacco, wine, coffee or tea by children is well known to be highly injurious.\\nNever allow a child  to use either of these—not even in small quantities. A too common\\npractice in many families is to allow a little wine at dinner “to assist digestion!” Others allow\\ncoffee or tea, “becau se my child is so fond of it.” “The after-effects of all these  is to disturb\\nthe heart, to cause nervousness and irritability , and to weaken the sexua l organs in a marked\\ndegree. Tobacco particularly has this last effect in old and young, besides producing\\nconvulsions, a dulled intellect, etc.” [D]\\nRemember where the brain is and the purposes for which it has been given! Here reside\\nthe knowledge and the power to govern all below it. No matter what the stomach craves or\\nhow stron gly the appetite begs for this or that; no matter how much one may be tempted to\\nsteal, to lie or to swear; no matter how much the sexual organs may lead one to think about or\\nhandle them—here is the great and good brain, the home of the will-power , which says:\\n“Touch not, taste not, handle not.” So long as these commands are listened to and obeyed,\\none is safe. The desire need not and should not control the act—but the rational faculty can\\nand will control, when early taught to do so. The more one is led by this ration al faculty the\\neasier it becomes to follow it, and vice versa .\\nWhat has been said above regarding the danger of little boys falling into bad habits\\napplies with equal force to little girls. Do not forget this. They too may have sexual thoughts,\\nfeelings and curiosity , and care must be taken to keep their minds pure and bodies healthy .\\nThey are also liable to disorders that require prompt and careful attention, such as\\ninflammations , excoriations, itchings and swellings of the genital organs with dischar ges\\nfrom these  parts resembling leucorrhœa . All such conditions lead them to more or less rub\\nand scratc h these parts—which should never be touched—for relief. Pleasurable sensations\\nare experienced and then comes masturbation— a sin chargeable to the parent for not having\\ngiven the matter proper medical attention. “Repeated washings” will no more cure these\\ncases in little girls than, as shown above, will they cure in little boys . All these are but the\\noutcropping of some constitutional affection and should be treated accordingly . No\\napplications or medicated washings of any kind should be allowed. Such exter nal treatment\\nonly palliates the suffering for a little while without removing the disordered vital force that\\ngave origin to its appearance. This is simply repressed and may react upon the child and\\nappear in another form tenfold worse than the first. The passing of urine or fecal matter may(in either sex) cause  irritation and excoriation; this is another sign that all is not right in the\\nvital force s and should be mentioned to the physician as a sure index that medical treatment,\\nbut not topical applications, is absolute ly necessary . All abnormal appearances, actions and\\ndiscomforts of the child, whether mental or physical, should be submitted to an experienced\\nand judicious physician. A healthy child should be happy and comfortable in all respects.\\nA very successful plan for keeping children from vice or vicious habits is to see that their\\ntime is fully occupi ed with amusements and duties which interest them. They need a great\\ndeal of harmlessly conducted amuseme nt and—do not strive to “keep them quiet.” Allow\\nlittle boys  and girls to play together , under proper surveillance, and let them be boisterous if\\nthey will; let them romp and run, climb fences, trundle hoops, jump rope, go to dancing\\nschool, participate in military drills, go coasting and skating, take swimming lessons, etc.\\nNo judicious parents will allow a son or daughter to be alone much; to seek to be alone is\\nalways a bad sign and should be careful ly guarded against without its being known that such\\nprecaution is observed. Furnish them liberally with instructive and innocent story books and\\nlet them read aloud to you or to each other. Take them to walk or ride when you go, and strive\\nto make companions of them as much as possible, making whatever sacrifices are necessary\\nto attain this end. Above all, encourage their making confidants of you. Let them  feel that\\nthey can come and talk freely on any subject, no matter what its nature may be. Do this, and\\nyou have thrown around them a bulwar k of defence that will withstand the repeated attacks\\nof hosts of evil spirits. When night comes and they go to bed, let them learn to go to sleep at\\nonce; no play then—they may be read to sleep, but no romping or playing . No strange\\nchildren should be allowed to sleep with yours; make them occupy separate rooms or at least\\nseparate beds; be sure that the sleeping places of your children are sacred to them alone. Nor\\nis it advisable for children to sleep with a grown person of either sex and particu larly not with\\nservants—all for obvious reasons.\\nThe observance of all these precautio ns against influences that might excite sexual\\ndisturbance is most sacred in its character and most needful even in a religious point of view;\\nfor there should be chastity  above all things.A\",\n",
       " \"CHAPTER IV .\\nADOLESCENCE OF THE MALE.\\nDOLESCENCE  of the male embraces the period of life from the age of fourteen or\\nsixteen years to the age of twenty-five.\\nAt about the age of fourteen years “the period of youth is distinguished by that advance in\\nthe evolut ion of the generative apparatus in both sexes, and by that acquirement of its power\\nof functional activity , which constitutes the state of Puberty .” At this age the following great\\nchanges take place in the general appearance and deportment of the male: His frame becomes\\nmore angu lar and the masculine proportions more pronounced; increased streng th and greater\\npowers of enduranc e are manifested; the larynx enlar ges and the voice becomes lower in\\npitch as well as rougher and more powerful; new feelings and desires awaken  in the mind.\\nHis depor tment becomes more commanding, his frivolity is less and less apparent, and the\\nboy is lost in the man. If he has been so fortunate as to escape all the danger s and baneful\\ninfluences of childhood, he is manly indeed, and we behold him with an unburdened\\nconscience, bright intellect, frank address and good memory . His spirits are buoyant and his\\ncomplexion clear; every function of his body is well performed, and no fatigue is felt after\\nmoderate exertion. He evinces that elasticity of body , and that happy control of himself and\\nhis feeling s, which are indicative of the robust health and absence of care which should\\naccompany youth. His time is devoted to his studies, duties and amusements; as he feels his\\nstature increase, and his intellect enlar ge, he gladly prepares for his coming struggle with the\\nworld.\\nAll boys may come to this condition with proper training through the period of infancy\\nand childhood; and after arriving at the adolescent age of their existence as they have the\\npower of mind to choose , so also have they the power to refuse . The human race is created\\nabove the animal so that we are something more than mere animals; we are human beings\\nwith human propensities, human passions, human desires and human tastes, which are\\nsubject to the human brain, to the human reason and to the human will—all elevated and\\nennobled by the Divine Will. Man must not let himself down to be govern ed by animal\\npassions; the moment he does that, his higher powers suffer and become weakened, and he\\nbecomes more like an inferior animal; if he persists in this downward course, his lower\\npowers become strengthened until finally they transcend and rule the higher . Then, to all\\nintents and purposes, such a man's head is downwards and the lower part of his body is\\nupwards just where his head ought to be.\\nMan is a human being, yet, like the whole animal kingdom, he has appetites, desires and\\npassions, as it is absolutely necessary that he should have. He has organs corresponding tothese appetites, desires and passions, and it is necessary that he should have them. A proper\\nunderstanding in regard to this matter will convince anyone of the truth of this assertion. Our\\nCreator doeth all things wisely and well, in the most perfect manner possible. Consequently ,\\nman with all his organs, parts and passions is just what he should be when he blossoms into\\nyouth, in the perfection of his adolescence as described above. In fact there could be no other\\nform of creating man, for the Lord alway s creates in the most perfect way possible, according\\nto one harmonious law which He has ordained to govern the creation of all beings.\\nSuch a man is fully prepared to struggle with himself and the world at large. In his\\ndesires, appetites or passions of any kind, he, in his humanity , protected by his rational\\nfaculties and enlightened by the Divin e Oracle of God, unquestionably has the power to\\nchoose between propriety and impropriety , between the right and the wrong, between the\\ngood and the bad. Take any evil into which a member of the human family may fall—the\\nlove of ardent spirit  for instance; he first thinks of it and desires to partake of some. Finally\\nhe takes an opportu nity to gratify his desire, does satisfy it for the time and thinks it very\\nnice. The next craving is a little more intense, and he cannot overcome the temptation quite\\nso easily as he could have done before, and at last he indulges again. So he goes on, step by\\nstep, until he may fall very low. The same thinking, feeling and desiri ng precedes  the\\nadoption of every vicious habit that was ever formed.  Nor will anyone pretend to say that a\\npersistent effort of the will power , at the very outset, when he first perceived the tendencies\\nof his desires to do what he need not do, would not have prevented the evil; no argumentation\\nwill preva il in the face of stubborn facts, and the real facts are all on the side of purity and\\norder .\\nThese very young men or youths, as they progress through adolescence, may become\\ntempted in a variety  of ways, some to the use of ardent spirits or tobacco, others to lie, to\\nsteal, to forge, &c.; but the approach to all these evils is gradual and first comes through the\\nmind. They first think about the action, turn it over and over in their minds until they come to\\ngreatly desire and then, later, to commit the evil which would not have been ultimated if the\\nmind had been persistently set against it in the beginning. This is an indisputable fact.\\nIn this manner many  promising youths, just as they are blossoming into the pride of early\\nmanhood, begin to indulge in sexual thoughts and to allow these thoughts to influence their\\nminds until they commit some of the evils to which perverted and unchaste passions lead\\nthem. If this evil be masturbation, then they are on the direct road to ruin, as will be seen\\ndescribed further on. If it be the commission of sexual intercourse with women , their ruin is\\nstill more certain, and in the latter case they are exposed to one of the worst poisons that can\\npossibly infect the human race. I do not overdraw the picture when I declare that millions of\\nhuman beings die annually from the effects of poison contracted in this way, in some form of\\nsuffering or another; for, by insinuating its effects into and poisoning the whole man, it\\ncomplicates various  disorders and renders them incurable. When gonorrhœa is contracted,\\nalthough frequently suppressed by local treatment in the form of injections, it is never\\nperfectly cured thereby . No; the hidden poison runs on for a life time producing strictures,\\ndysuria, gleet and kindred diseases; finally , in old men, a horrible prostatitis results from\\nwhich the balance of one's life is rendered miserable indeed. If inflammation of the lungs\\nsupervenes, there is often a translation of the virus to these vital organs, causing what is\\ntermed “plastic pneumonia,” where one lobule after another becomes gradually sealed up, till\\nnearly the whole of both lungs becomes impervious to air , and death results from asphyxia.\\nThis horri ble infection sometimes becomes engrafted upon other acute diseases when\\nlingering disorders follow , causing years of misery , and only terminating in death.If real syphilis, in the form of chancre, should be contracted, and in that form suppressed,\\nwe have buboes often of a malignant type, ulceration of the penis and a loss of some portion\\nof this member . Sometimes the poison attacks the throat, causing most destructive ulcerations\\ntherein; sometimes it seizes upon the nasal bones, resulting in their entire destruction and an\\nawful disfiguration of the face; sometim es it ultimates itself in the ulceration and destruction\\nof other osseous tissues in different portions of the body . Living examples of these facts are\\ntoo frequently witnessed in the streets of any large city. Young men marrying with the\\nslightest taint of this poison in the blood will surely transmit the disease to their children.\\nThousands of abortions transpire every year from this cause alone, the poison being so\\ndestructive as to kill the child in utero, before it is matured  for birth; and even if the child be\\nborn alive, it is liable to break down with the most loathsome disorders of some kind and to\\ndie during dentition; the few that survive this period are short lived and are unhealthy so long\\nas they do live. The very first unchaste connection of a man with a woman may be attended\\nwith a contamination entailing upon him a life of suffering and even death itself. There is no\\nsafety among impure or loose women whether in private homes or in the very best regulated\\nhouses of ill-fame; even in Paris, where, after women have been carefully examined and\\npronounced free from any infec ting condition, the first man who visits one of them, often\\ncarries away a deadly enemy in his blood, which had lurked in concealment beyond the keen\\neye of the inspecto r. A young man, or a man at any age, is in far greater danger amidst\\ncompany of this stamp, than he would be with a clear conscience and pure character in the\\nmidst of the wildest forest, full of all manner of poisonous serpents and wild beasts of every\\ndescription. A knowledge of the above facts should be enough to chill the first impulse and to\\nmake any man who respects his own well-being, turn away and flee from the destruction that\\nawaits him.\\nAs if the above sufferings were not a sufficient penalty for the transgression against the\\nlaw—“Be ye pure,” we find yet another . Coincident with the physical wreck, which syphilis\\nmakes of the man who becomes thoroughly tainted with its poison, comes his moral wreck.\\nHe loses all respect for the truth and all regard for his word; no dependence of any kind can\\nbe placed upon him, and he will not pay his debts or fulfil any moral obligatio n; all because\\nhe began by prostituting his mind more and more until, with deadened consc ience, almost\\nliterally , his head is dependent and his feet uppermost, ruling all the better part of his nature.\\nAnd next come the mental sufferings— and most agonizing they are. Unhappy to the last\\ndegree, he no longer takes pleasure in life, but, wishing to die, finally commits suicide. A\\nsearch in any insane asylum will show that a very large proportion of patients are made up\\nfrom those who masturbate or have syphilis. Stamp out these two evils, or rather curses  of the\\nhuman race, and the supply that feeds our insane asylums, aye and our penit entiaries, too,\\nwill become vastly lessened. Think of it! So many of the inhabitants of our prisons, asylums,\\nand our poor-houses, are composed of men and women who have offended against nature's\\nlaws by violating their own sexual nature. Add to this summary the list of broken-hearted,\\ndeflowered vir gins and unwedded mothers, and you have the picture complete.\\nWhat a contrast with that manliness of character from which he has fallen! Now he is in\\nan insane condition, blaming everyone for having contributed to his many misfortunes and\\nhis fallen condition, whereas he alone is the culprit. No one made him commit the first or any\\nsubsequent evil. He allowed his own mind to yield to the first temptation, and then went on\\nfrom step to step, he alone being responsible for the result Yield not the first point, and all is\\nsafe.\\nThe pride of perfect adolescence, as described a few pages back, is due to purity of\\nthought, to chastity and continence. This purity shines through every tissue, enkindles the eyewith a true expressio n, makes bright the countenance and erects the form. It gives elasticity to\\nthe step, causes harmony in the tones of the voice, and adds dignity to the carriage and\\ndeportment. The first step in the paths of vice in any form, whether in sexual errors or any\\nother , detracts in the exact degree of the digression from all of the above beautiful and\\nennobling characteristics.\\nWe have spoken in the preceding pages of new feelings and desires being awakened in\\nthe youth after his fourteenth year. This change is wholly due to his approaching  manhood, to\\nthe time when he will be fully prepared to appreciate, to love and protect, guide and support\\nher whom he makes his wife, and to become the father of happy and healthy children. But\\nthis approach to manhood is not due to the development of the genital organs, as some writers\\naffirm, for this would be a reversion of orderly development. The approaching manhood\\ndevelops in full accordance to their uses and importance all the organs belonging to man. As\\nthe well-developed infant has all its organs developed in a condition suitable for its state, and\\nthe child has all its organs in all parts of the body , developed in full accord with its state, so\\nadolescence follows, and every organ must develop accordingly; and in this development a\\nnew impe tus is given to every organ in the body . The whole man awakens to a newness of\\nlife as is seen in the change of his voice,  the spreading out of his frame, the independence and\\ncommand of his bearing, the activity of his brain, the soundness of his judgment, until he\\nbecomes in the fullest sense a rational being. Of course the development of his genital organs\\nkeeps pace with that of his brain; but the brain should lead the way throughout the entire\\ndevelopment of the human race.\\nAt the time of puberty , then, a new and a different sensation springs up in the generative\\norgans, which is in perfect harmony with the uses for which they are intended. We recognize\\nthe use of the hands, the fingers, the feet, the eyes, the ears, the sense of taste, &c., and we\\nuse them accordingly . We should think of the generative organs only in the same light. They\\nare intended for use, for the highest and holiest use of procreating human beings to the end\\nthat they may become angels in heaven. These organs were not made to be abused; but they\\nare abused every time the mind is allow ed to dwell upon them improperly . Every excitation\\nwe allow from lewd thoughts or fancie s, has a debasing and deteriorating effect upon that\\nwell-developed form , upon that conscience so free, and upon that countenance so open and\\nbright, which has been described in the preceding pages.\\nIf the mere thought and excitation arisin g therefrom are injurious to the perfection of the\\nyouth, how much more injurious must be the ultimation of that thought in masturbation, in\\nunlawful sexual intercourse, or in the loss of seminal fluid by other unnatural means.\\nRight here I feel impelled to say something of the\\nDIFFICULTY OF MAINTAINING CHASTITY.\\nI, in connection with many of our best and wisest men who have given the subject a\\nlifetime's most earnest consideration, hold that for a young man whose early education has\\nbeen carefully looked to, and consequently , whose mind has not been debased by vile\\npractices, it is no more impossible mentally , or injurious physically , to preserv e his chastity\\nthan to refrain from yielding to any other of the innumerable temptations with which his life\\nis beset. And every year of voluntary chastity renders the task easier by mere force of habit. \",\n",
       " \"I\\nwish to be clearly understood in this matter .\\nSo long as a young man remains chaste  in thought and deed, he will not suffer any bad\\neffects from his continence. It is the semicontinent , the man who know s the right but pursuesthe wrong , who suffers! Patients frequently complain that enforced continence  makes them\\nrestless, irritable, unfit for mental application of any sort, &c. Sexual intercourse is then\\nindulged in, and presto: for the time being, what a welcome change. The now unclogged\\nmind grasps with vigor any subject presented to it, the spirits are exuberant and the physical\\nframe buoyant. But, is the trouble cured, is it permanently eradicated from the system? No! In\\na short time the symptoms reappear and the same remedy is again sought. The more the\\nsexual feelings are indulged the more frequent will be their recurrence, and the result need\\nnot be written; every  candid mind can easily see it. To their shame and confusi on be it said,\\nthere are many physicians who, when consulted by their patients for medical  assistance in\\nsuch trials, “deliberately encourage the early indulgence of the passions, on the false and\\nwicked ground that self-restraint is incompatible with health. What abhorrence can be too\\ndeep for a doctrine so destructive, or for the teachers who thus, before the eyes of those\\nwhose youthful ignorance, whose sore natural temptation, rather call for the wisest and\\ntenderest guidance and encouragement, put darkness for light, evil for good, and bitter for\\nsweet.” [E]\\nI declare emphatically that no symptoms of sexual suffering, no matter how feelingly\\ndescribed or cunningly insinuated, shou ld ever lead a physician to prescribe for a young man\\nthat fatal remedy , illicit intercourse. Medically as a physician, morally as a Christian, and\\nsympathizingly as a fellow being, I record a solemn protest against such false treatment. It is\\nbetter for a youth to live a continent life. The strictly chaste suffer comparatively little sexual\\nirritability; but the incontinent, at recurring periods are sure to be troubled in one or other of\\nthe ways spoken of; and the remedy of indulgence, if effective, requires repetition as often as\\nthe inconvenience returns. No! When thus consulted, let the physician prescribe the proper\\nmedicament, if one be necessary; and let him direct a plain, nourishing, non-stimulating diet,\\nphysical exertion of any kind carried to exhaustion, and SELF CONTROL.\\nWould any young man in his senses listen to a physician, who, for lowness of spirits,\\nmental despondency , &c., should tell him to drink plentifully of brandy or eat hasheesh? On\\nthe same principle then let a youth shun the physician, who, for sexual excitement, prescribes\\nsexual indulgence.\\nAgain, such compla ints coming from young men are very often specious, and are mere\\nsubterfuges—overdrawn pictures of their sufferings—which are presented as an excuse for\\nindulging the sensual emotions, instead of manfully and righteously struggling  to overcome\\nthem. And further , “if anyone wishes to really experience the acutest sexual suffering, he can\\nadopt no more certai n method than to be incontinent with the intention of becom ing continent\\nagain, when he has ‘sown his wild oats.’ The agony of breaking off a habit which so rapidly\\nentwines itself with every fibre of the human frame (as sexual indulgence) is such that it\\nwould not be too much to say in the Wise Man's words, ‘None  that go to her retur n again,\\nneither take they hold on the paths of life.’”\\n“The sin, of all, most sure to blight—\\nThe sin, of all, that the soul's light\\nIs soonest lost, extinguished in.”\\nRemember then that sexual suffering comes to the incontinent  man, and that it is far\\neasier , even for the fully developed vigorous adult, to continue in control of these feelings,\\nthan when they have been once excited and indulged.One singl e impure connection may entail a whole life of syphilitic suffering on the\\nunhappy transgressor . Would this “pay?”\\nNo inducement could persuade me to assume the awful responsibilities of advis ing illicit\\nintercourse. Apart from Christian princi ple, I know that there is no necessity , physiological,\\npathological or any other , that can excuse any physician for saying that the Seventh\\nCommandment may ever be broken. My sentiments on the physiological side of the question\\nare so admirably expressed by Acton, [F] that I will here quote from him.\\n“One argument in favor of incontinen ce deserves special notice, as it purports to be\\nfounded on physiology . I have been consulted by persons who feared, or professed to fear,\\nthat if the organs were not exercised regularly , they would become atrophied, or that in some\\nway impotence might be the result of chastity . This is the assigned reason for committing\\nfornication. There exists no greater  error than this, or one more opposed to physiological\\ntruth. In the first place, I may state that I have, after many years' experience, never seen a\\nsingle instance of atrophy of the generative organs from this cause. I have, it is true, met with\\nthe complaint—but in what class of cases does it occur? It arises in all instances from the\\nexactly opposite cause—abuse: the organs become worn out, and hence arises atrophy .\\nPhysiologically considered, it is not a fact that the power of secreting semen is annihilated in\\nwell-formed adults leading a healthy life and yet remaining continent. The function goes on\\nin the organ always, from puberty to old age. Semen is secreted sometimes slowly , sometimes\\nquickly , and very frequently under the influence of the will. No continent man need be\\ndeterred by this apoc ryphal fear of atrophy of the testes from living a chaste life. It is a device\\nof the unchaste—a lame excuse for their own incontinence, unfounded on any physiological\\nlaw. The testes will take care that their action is not interfered with.”\\nMany and many a time have I heard it regretted and bemoaned, on account of the many\\ntroubles they had seemed to cause, that the sexual organs exist. It is the lewd thoughts and\\nuses to which they are put that causes all this misery , and there is always that “first thought”\\nwhich should not be harbored. Cast away the impure thoughts, rise above them , and one is\\nsafe! Pure thoughts can never  lead to harm.\\nThe generative organs, with their functions and uses, are most closely interwo ven with\\nthe highest destiny and well being of the race physically , mentally and spiritual ly; they are a\\npart of us, without which there would be no men and women, lovers and loved ones, fathers\\nand mothers, brothers and sisters. We must then happily accept the situation as it is, and our\\nbodies, parts and passions as they are; for they are all indispensable, high and holy, when\\nkept in an orderly and chaste condit ion. We only need the above knowledge and its\\napplication to make ourselves as happy  in the enjoyment of these organs as it was designed\\nby our Creator that we should be.\\nTo rise above the sexual temptations that may be more or less experienced by many and\\nperhaps by all, requires an effort of course, and frequently a very great effort; but let it be\\nborne in mind that all temptations to do wrong, require effort to overcome them; and as a\\nrule, the greater the evil we are tempted to commit the greater is the effort needed to\\novercome it. Now , as shown above, since sexual matters are so thoroughly interwoven with\\nthe highest destinies of the human race, physically , mentally and spiritually , there is scarcely\\nany function of higher import, allotted  to any individual, than that assigned to the genital\\norgans. No function more deeply concerns the healthfulness of the body , the clearness and\\nbrilliancy of the intellect, or the purity and sincerity of the soul itself.Several times in the course of this book I have referred to the term “abuse.” By “abuse,” \",\n",
       " \"I\\nmean precisely what Lallemand  so forcibly expresses as follows: “I understa nd by the term\\nabuse, when applied to the organs of generation, any irregular or prematur e exercise of their\\nfunctions; any application of them which cannot have, as its result, the propagation of the\\nspecies. ”\\nLook at the habitual masturbator! See how thin, pale and haggard he appears ; how his\\neyes are sunken; how long and cadaverous is his cast of countenance; how irritable he is and\\nhow sluggish, mentally and physically; how afraid he is to meet the eye of his fellows; feel\\nhis damp and chilling hand, so characteristi c of great vital exhaustion. Taken as a class, how\\nterrible are their lost virility , their miserable night's sleep, their convulsions and their\\nshrunken limbs. They keep by themselves, seeking charm in solitude and are fit companions\\nfor no one; they dare not read their Bible, they cannot commune with good angels nor with\\nthe Lord, our Saviou r. Is not this picture deplorable? It is at the last end of the chain I admit,\\nbut it is reached link after link, one at a time; and the first link was forged when the first\\ntemptation in the mind was first favored and finally yielded to. The above picture is a true\\none and shows how intimately connected are the soul, the mind and the body with this whole\\nsubject. Man in a healthy state need not and should not lose one drop of semina l fluid by his\\nown hand, by nightly emissions or pollutions, or in any way, until he becomes conjoined to a\\nwife of his choice in the holy bonds of matrimony . Every time the seed of his body is lost in a\\ndisorderly or unnatural way, he injures  the finest textures of his brain correspondingly , as\\nwell as the finest and most exalted condition of his mind and soul, because the act proceeds\\nin its incipiency from a willful prostitution of these higher powers.\\nWhen sexual thoughts and temptations  arise in one's mind, even very young  men are\\ncapable of putting them away , urged by the thought that tampering with one's generative\\norgans is wrong. He should intuitively feel that it is something akin to theft, or a crime of\\nsome worse sort, for him to indulge in solitary vice and he should intuitively feel an inward\\nreproach for all such meditations. When one is sorely tempted in these matters, as is often the\\ncase, let him reflect that he was not created to indulge in such pleasures by himself, and that\\nto do so is a crime, a sin against the God of Heaven; that it is his destiny , his privilege and\\none of the uses of his life to share such enjoyments with the wife of his bosom; and that all\\nexcitement or dallying with this part of his nature before marriage only serves to weaken his\\nsexual powers, as well as his mind and body; also, that it mars his sexual uses and will detract\\nfrom his sexual pleasures in the married  life. Sexual indulgence of any sort in a young man is\\na loss, not only to himself but also, prospectively , to that dear girl whom he will some day\\nmake his wife. Such reflections will often drive away the temptation entirely . If they are not\\nsufficient to do so let him read some interesting book that shall take his mind away  from the\\nsubject; or, that failing, let him take exercise, vigorous exercise—pushed to fatigue, if\\nnecessary . If these states of temptation occur in bed at night, let him rise and read, plunge his\\narm into very cold water, or if necessary go forth into the open air and seek relief in a rapid\\nwalk. It is better to go to any amount of trouble and to endure any physical discomfort, than\\nto sacrifice one's chastity , the loss of which can never be replaced.\\nA young man naturally desires and expects chastity of the strictest order in the young\\nwoman of his choic e for a wife. Who would marry a girl, no matter how beautiful or how\\nmany and varied her accomplishments if it were known that she had granted her favors to any\\nother man? And yet, what less has she a perfect  right to require from a youn g man who\\npresumes to pay his addresses to her? This consideration, too, should serve as a restraint to\\nany amorous desires that might infest  a man's mind. It is wonderful how keen are theperceptions of a pure minded young lady to detect even an approach to licentiousness in the\\nmale. He is abhorrent to her and his very sphere betrays him.\\nWith the facts of the preceding pages, contained in this chapter being known, it does seem\\nas if every man would keep himself pure from all carnal associations and use the utmost care\\nnot to prostitute his mind, that he may approach the nuptial altar as pure in mind and body as\\nhe would have her who is to become the idol of his heart.\\nNow this is all very beautiful in theory and desirable in practice, but is it practical ? Can\\nman so school himself in self denia l as to accomplish this end? Are there not real\\nphysiological facts existing which utterly preclude the possibility of this most desirable\\nresult? Do not, as has been alleged by some writers, the testicles of man secrete semen until\\nthey beco me so surchar ged that emission becomes absolutely necessary , and does not this\\naccumulation actual ly produce such sexual excitement that man feels compelled  to seek relief\\nin some way? I answer, most unhesitatingly , NO! The above questions are all theories and\\nutterly devoid of fact.\\nWould Almighty God command, “Thou shalt not commit adultery ,” and then so create\\nman as to compel him to break his Divine injunction?\\nAbundance of proof is at hand to substantiate this sweeping remark of mine, were this the\\nplace to produce it. Seminal fluid is abundantly secreted and produced only during the height\\nof sexual excitemen t in the male. As Acton remarks: “It is a highly organized fluid requiring\\nthe expenditure of much vital force in its elaboration and its expulsion.” It is secreted from\\nthe blood of his body and the whole man physically , mentally and spiritually  is concerned\\nand represented in its product; consequently the action requires an effort of the whole man,\\nand, if often repeated, the effect is very exhausting to the physical powers, to the mind and to\\nthe brain. Let this be another warning to remain in purity of heart.\\nWe have said in the preceding pages that man, in a healthy state, need not lose a drop of\\nseminal fluid until after marriage. There are many abnormal causes resulting  in what are\\ncalled wet dreams, nightly pollutions,  spermatorrhœa, prostatic emission during stool or\\nurination, also diurnal emissions witho ut erection. These may result from over study , from\\nerrors in diet such as use of coffee, highly seasoned food, wines, spirituous liquors or drugs\\nof various kinds—though perhaps prescribed by a physician. When these troubles arise from\\nconstitutional disord ers, a skillful physic ian must be consulted at once. Errors in diet and the\\ntaking of drugs causing this trouble must of course be discontinued. [G]“Certain medicines—\\nas astringents, purgatives, narcotics, stimulants and diuretics especially—may bring on\\nconditions from which spermatorrhœa may arise.” Among other causes Lallem and refers to\\nthe use of quinine, tobacco and, particularly alcohol . The trouble may also arise from injurie s\\nand many other accidental causes, besides masturbation and venereal excesses.\\nIt is distressing to see what a complete  wreck seminal losses make of those who were\\nonce robust and healthy young men, and what a shock they give to the nervous system. They\\nbecome weak, pale, and feeble in mind, while all that was manly and vigorous has gone out\\nof them. Now which of the two is preferable—the pride of a virtuous youth, or the roué\\nexhausted and worn out by sexual abuses? It demands great strength to becom e either , but\\nreally a much great er effort for the latter; because it requires very great perse verance for a\\nchaste and pure minded man to debase himself by such practices. It depends on the mind\\nwhich is all right before yielding the first point; therefore beware and shun the first step\\ndownward. Strength en the moral courag e and exercise the will power so as always to be able\\nto say , “No,” to whatever temptation the conscience tells you is wrong.A\",\n",

Unlike the male, the forms which in him are angular, become\\nin her rounded, symmetrical and beautiful, and the characteristic feminine proportions are\\nwell marked; she becomes more gracef ul in her movements, her voice grows sweeter , more\\nmellow , more power ful and capable of registering a higher tone. New feelings and desires are\\nawakened in her mind. Her deportment becomes more commanding and less frivolous, and\\nthe girl is lost in the woman.\\nIf she has been so fortunate as to have escaped all the dangers and baneful influences of\\ninfantile and childho od life, she is womanly indeed, and we behold her with an unburdened\\nconscience, clear intellect, artless and candid address, good memory , buoyant spirits, a\\ncomplexion bright, clear and, as the poet declares, “beautiful exceedingly .” Every function of\\nher body is well performed, and no fatigue is experienced after moderate exertion. She\\nevinces that elasticity of spirit and gracefulness of body , and happy control of her feelings\\nwhich indicate healthfulness of both mind and body . Her whole time is given up to her\\nstudies, duties and amusements; and as she feels her stature increase and her intellect enlar ge,\\nshe gladly prepares for her coming strug gle with the world—though in a manner becoming to\\nher sex. This, too, is no fanciful sketch, but is realized in thousands of cases every year. It is\\none which  parents feel proud to witness in a daughter , and one in which the daughter takes a\\nmodest delight. We have said that every function of her body is well performed. The\\nfunctions of the female body , which in a state of health are perfectly free from pain, are very\\nnumerous and, in the four years from fourteen to eighteen, she accomplishes an amount of\\nphysiological cell change and growth which Nature does not require of a boy in less than\\ntwice that number of years. It is obvious, therefore, that a girl upon whom Nature, for a\\nlimited period and for a definite purpose , imposes so great a physiological task, will not have\\nas much power left for the tasks of school as a boy, of whom Nature requires less at the\\ncorresponding epoch. The functions of circulation, respiration, digestion, perspiration,\\nnutrition and menstruation, though involuntary , are all important, dependent one upon\\nanother , and all develop at the proper time. Puberty is the proper time for the appearance of\\nmenstruation, one of the most important and sacred of her functions. It should not be feared,\\ndreaded or regarded as a nuisance; it forms a part of herself; and she never commands the\\nrespect and forbearance of her friends, or even of her enemies, more than when it is known\\nthat she is “unwell.” It serves in many ways as a blessing to her, rather than aninconvenience. Let no young girl be alarmed, as, owing to the negligence of her parents or\\nguardians, many are, at the first appearance of this flow of blood from the genital organs. She\\nshould keep more quiet than usual, at these times, until the flow disappears, which it will do\\nin a few days. In a state of health these appearances occur every twenty-eight days and the\\nyoung lady should exercise extreme caution at such times, in avoiding unnece ssary fatigue,\\nexposure to cold, getting wet, suddenly cooling off when heated, etc. One of the reasons why\\nso many suffer at this time is due to the want of proper knowledge and care, also for the want\\nof a proper feeling about the matter . I have known young ladies to be guilty of the almost\\nincredible crime of trying to arrest the flow by plugging up the vagina and by resorting to\\nother means, that they might attend a dancing party or some pleasure excur sion. Such a\\nprocedure is sure to be followed by the direst retribution to the offender . Nature  never allows\\nher laws to be so trifled with. Some experience a deep mortification on account of this\\nfunction; some think it a very great inconvenience and a nuisance—an obstacle to their\\npleasure; others feel unhappy and vexed  about it. In truth, every woman should  consider it a\\nprivilege and should regard menstruatio n as it really is, a blessing from heaven; and, when\\nrightly performed, a help to lend loveliness to her character , beauty to her expression, music\\nto her voice, and gracefulness to her form and movements.\\nMothers or guardians should instruct young girls in good time as to the expected\\nmenstrual function and prepare their minds for its advent. They should also be carefully\\ninstructed in regard to the external use of water—of its attendant danger , lest they chill\\nthemselves sufficien tly to arrest this flow, which should continue uninterrup tedly until the\\nfunction is complete . Too many lives have been sacrificed by suppressing the monthly flux;\\nexternal ablutions should be plentiful, but only sufficient, as in the case of boys, for\\ncleanliness. If menstruation should not become healthfully established at the proper time of\\nage, consult a judicious physician who will see that any abnormal condition, preventing such\\nconsummation, is properly removed. “The principal organs of elimination, common to both\\nsexes, are the bowels, kidneys, lungs and skin. A neglect of their functions is punished in\\neach alike. To woman is intrusted the exclusive management of another process of\\nelimination, viz.: the catamenial function. This, using the blood for its channel of operation,\\nperforms, like the blood, double duty. It is necessary to ovulation, and to the integrity of\\nevery part of the reproductive apparatus; it also serves as a means of elimination for the blood\\nitself. A careless management of this function, at any period of life during its existence, is apt\\nto be followed by consequences that may be serious; but a neglect of it during the epoch of\\ndevelopment, that is, from the age of fourteen to eighteen or twenty , not only produces great\\nevil at the time of the neglect, but leaves a large legacy of evil to the future. The system is\\nthen peculiarly susceptible; and disturba nces of the delicate mechanism we are considering,\\ninduced during the catamenial weeks of that critical age by constrained positions, muscular\\neffort, brain work, and all forms of mental and physical excitement, germinate a host of\\nills.” [H]\\nHere I must be allowed to protest most solemnly against the use of injection s into the\\nvagina for the so-called purpose of cleanliness. Vaginal syringes are constructed and used\\nnow by thousands and the sufferings of the human race are increased thereby ten thousand\\nfold proportionately . The vagina, like all organs supplied with a mucous membrane, is self-\\ncleansing. Water, or any other fluid thrown into this organ, has a tendency to disorder the\\nmucous follicles, to dry up their secretions and thus prevent the efflux of some of Nature's\\nnecessities. From this cause alone there will be a reaction upon the vaginal walls, upon the\\nneck of the uterus and the uterus itself; the ovaries also become disordered; the lungs\\nsympathize as well as the throat and bronchial tubes, producing hoarseness, hacking coughand a host of troubles following in their train. Nervous headaches of fearful intensity are\\nfrequently produced from this unnatural course of procedure. Moreover , water thrown into\\nthe vagina, to wash  it out, day after day for a considerable time, absolutely produces a\\nleucorrhœa most persistent in character . This is the confession of young ladies to me in\\nmaking inquiry as to the origin of their trouble, and I have found that the dischar ge was\\nunknown to some of them till after the use of these injections. It stands to reason that such\\nunnatural washings  should be followe d by a retribution equal to the error committed,\\nbecause, as before stated, Nature's laws cannot be perverted without a penalty . A girl should\\nnever , under any pretext whatever , resort to such unhallowed means for the cure or\\nalleviation of leucorrhœa, ulceration, or for any disorders that affect these parts. By so doing\\nshe is really formin g a basis for innumerable future ills. If the girl is well, she has none of\\nthese disorders, for they all arise from constitutional derangements. As all must acknowledge,\\nit is a self-evident fact—that, if a woman is well, every part of her must be well also; no one\\norgan can, unaided, get up a disease by itself. In all troubles of this nature, as well as of any\\nother , consult a judicious physician.\\nThere are objections , however , of even a graver nature than those urged above against the\\nuse of such instruments. They often excite sensations in the parts to which they are applied,\\nthat should remain perfectly dormant in the unmarried state. After awhile these sensations,\\nincreasing in frequency and influence, serve to prostitute the mind and the young lady may\\nbecome ruined for life. I am stating facts that can be proved by multitudes of living witnesses\\nto-day in cases and confessions that have come under my own observation. On remonstrating\\nagainst this habit, some remark, “But it feels so nice, doctor!” Of course, ablutions of the\\nexternal  organs are perfectly right and prope r and should be resorted to daily . To the\\nreflecting mind no more need be said about this matter . Those who wish to live in harmony\\nwith the order of their creation and thereby preserve the freshness of health, will not have\\nrecourse to such means as add new derangements to the system.\\nTo preserve feminine charms as the girl develops into womanhood, much depends upon\\nher mental state. She must not allow herself to bear malice towards anyone, must not plot evil\\nor attempt to “pay off others in their own coin,” as it is called, or seek revenge  in any way;\\nbut she must ever cultivate a forgiving disposition, good thoughts and good feelings towards\\neveryone. There is always danger of meeting both rude and lewd girls, and that too in places\\nwhere least expected; they may be found in schools of all kinds and are occasionally met with\\nin the houses of one's own friends. Not very long since a charming young lady wrote me from\\na neighbor ing city, that while sharing a bed with another girl, she experienced a very strange\\nsensation induced by the improper liberties of her bed-fellow; and so persistent were these\\ntroublesome sensations, although occup ying a bed by herself ever after, she thought it proper\\nto seek my advice. Now this was a good and pure-minded girl who might easily have been\\nruined but for her inherent love of chastity; and so our daughters are always in danger of\\nbeing contaminated. A perfectly pure and chaste mind, unsullied by impure thoughts or acts,\\nand cultivated by the exercise of all the Christian virtues, lends enchantmen t to the eye,\\nsweetness of expression to the face, music to the voice, and gracefulness  of carriage.\\nCultivation of merely external manner s will not do; they must spring from the mind and\\nthence they shine throughout the whole, in every fibre and movement of the body . Such an\\none is truly beloved wherever she goes; she has a real affection for her father and mother ,\\nbrothers and sisters; and she is fully prepared to appreciate and love one of the opposite sex\\nwhose purity of life and nobleness of mind fully corresponds to her own.\\nTo retain this charm of excellence will cost her many a trial and her temptations will be\\ninnumerable and very great. But her perceptive faculties are keen, and at the first suspicion ofanything wrong she must have the mora l courage to say: “No! that is not allowable, it is not\\nright,” or, “this is impure and its tendency is to vice.” Whatever the temptation may be, in\\nthought or in deed, let no one persuade  her into wrong-doing—not even her appar ently  best\\nfriend; for it would only be an appearance of friendship if he tempted to anything of a vicious\\nnature. She will be beset with hosts of admirers, some of them pure and having honorable\\nintentions; but (I am sorry to sound the note of warning here,) others will come with the most\\ndishonorable intentions possible, though with an air of sincerity , and apparently as artless as\\ndoves. Study all men long and carefully , keeping them meanwhile at a respec tful distance;\\nnever allow one to sit near with his arm about your waist or to hold your hand  in his; never\\nallow him to kiss you— the vilest of loathsome diseases may be communicated by a kiss viz.:\\nsyphilis . Do not allow any approach or touch beyond what is customary in the best of society\\nat a social gathering. Many a young lady with an angelic form and spotless soul within, full\\nof the best intention s and of the purest character , giving bright promise of a brilliant future,\\nhas been ruined for life by trusting herself alone with some of these apparently wise and\\ngood, yet really vile men.\\nYoung women have not, as a rule, any sexual propensity , or amorous thoughts or feelings.\\nIf they have been properly educated and cared for, they are, before marriage, perfect strangers\\nto any such sensations; and yet any young lady who falls, does so by her own hand and she\\nhas no one else to blame for it. Remember  that the Lord, in the beginning, never suffers\\ntemptations beyond one's strength to overcome. If she falls ultimately , it results from\\nallowing an impure  seed to be planted in the mind at first, which she then nourishes for a\\ntime and only in the end it bears its fruit.\\nAs time passes, a young lady forms an acquaintance with gentlemen, and at length she\\nfavors the addresses of one who is particularly agreeable to her. After this acquaintance has\\nripened into love, and she has become convinced of the purity of his heart, she enjoys being\\nwith him, in sitting by his side, and is unhappy in his absence. When betrothed,  owing to her\\ngreat and pure love for him, she takes pleasure in receiving such marks of affection from him\\nas are shown by a tender father or brother , but nothing more. After marriage, she feels that\\nshe is really his and that he has become a part of herself—that they are no more twain but are\\none flesh. All this has transpired without her hardly suspecting such a quality in herself as an\\namorous affection. Still she more than ever loves him, more than ever desires to be near him\\nuntil finally their union is fully and truly consummated by the marriage act. At no time in her\\nlife does a woman make a greater sacrifice of her feelings than at this time, and she does it\\nsolely for her pure and fervent love for him. This is right and proper , and is in accordance\\nwith the laws of order in the creation of the two sexes in the human, animal and vegetable\\nkingdoms throughout the world.\\nI wish here to have some “Plain Talk,” that the true object of this book may be more fully\\nunderstood and its mission more successfully accomplished. Unless willing to make the\\nabove sacrifice, no woman should ever marry; because she would not then be fulfilling the\\nmarriage covenant. Besides, she would be false to her husband and this falsity might cause\\nhis moral and physical destruction; his health would suffer and his manh ood become\\ndethroned, because her conduct would utterly controvert the immutable laws of nature.\\nNature's laws cannot possibly be set aside without the infliction of a severe  penalty . The\\nhealthy young woman will have no difficulty in preserving her chastity intact, so long as she\\ncultivates that purity of mind to which she is naturally prone. She should never allow herself\\nto read immoral stories or books having in the slightest degree even, such a tendency;\\ntheatrical plays with loose morals should also be avoided, and light, silly novels are verypernicious to the imaginative mind of the young. On the other hand useful reading stores the\\nmind with high and noble thoughts, whence spring good and useful deeds.\\nUnfortunately there are a variety of morbid conditions to which the female is liable, so\\nthat sexual desires arise in spite of every effort to keep aloof from them—even  though there\\nis not the slightest guilt in mental or bodily transgression. These are owing to disordered\\nconditions of the sexual system, just as other disorderly desires arise, and are often inherited\\n—remember this all parents!—or they may be caused by some morbific influ ences, as are\\nother diseased cond itions of the body . Many a time have I had pure-minded young ladies\\napply to me for medical aid in these matters, confessing that they had impure thoughts which\\nthey knew were wrong, but of which they could not rid themselves. In such cases there are\\nphysical symptoms of some kind that incite these thoughts and feelings. The proper medical\\nand hygienic treatment always restores order in such functional derangements and the sexual\\ndisturbances of the mind disappear . I have repeatedly cured nymphoman ia by curing\\nphysical, or constitu tional symptoms. In one case which came under my care, nymphomania\\nappeared in a married woman in the seventh month of her pregnancy , and so fearfully did her\\nmania rage that it threw her into convul sions. Her physical and sensational symptoms led me\\nto the choice of the medicine that cured her, so that she was happily delivered of a fine,\\nhealthy child at full term and no trace of the disease has ever appeared since. Too often young\\nwomen err and give way to such feelings in resorting to self-abuse  for relief, or to the\\ncaresses of the oppo site sex, when they are ruined forever . It is never safe to temporize or to\\ntamper in this way with such sensations. Women have heads and brains, as well as men, and\\nrational faculties, too. Every digression allowed, only paves the way for others,  with less and\\nless resistance, and more and more ruinous results. Let a judicious physician be consulted at\\nonce in all cases where a morbid condition seems to excite immoral thoughts and sensations.\\nThe effects of self-abuse upon woman, is as disastrous as masturbation upon males. A few\\nhours after its comm ission, or the next day at furthest, she feels languid and dragged out,\\nsleepy , unfit for reading anything solid , or studying, and unfit for social enjoyment with\\nothers; she looks pale and haggard; often she feels giddy , particularly when  rising in the\\nmorning, with many other discomforts too numerous to mention here. And is it true that some\\nyoung ladies, the sweetest and fairest of our race, play with one another in an immodest and\\nindecent way, teaching immorality to the pure and innocent? I fear it is, I know  it is. Such\\nthings need not, must not, and will not be tolerated. This little book will go about in all\\nclasses of society confirming and strengthening the pure in heart in their purity and\\nenlightening the ignorant who will joyfully hail the good news; all will join hands in one\\npopular cry against indecencies and indulgences of an impure nature; and the vilest man even\\nwill be taught to fear and respect the combined world of chaste female influence. So it must\\nbe and eventually will be; but woman, naturally pure and lovely woman! the greatest part of\\nthis work must be done by you.“ACHAPTER VI.\\nM\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00.\\nThe Husband.\\nND J\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 G\\x00\\x00 said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make\\nhim a help meet for him. * * * * And J\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 G\\x00\\x00 brought the woman unto the\\nman.

The love which brings them together and binds them together , flows into\\ntheir mind s from the Divine Love, from the love which has operated hitherto, and which now\\noperates, in creating and forming a Heaven of human beings.”\\nAll young men, on arriving at the age of twenty-five, other circumstances being\\nfavorable, should conform to the laws of Divine order and marry . “Whom shall we marry?\\nYoung ladies now-a-days require such an outfit and it costs so much to support a wife in the\\nstyle she wishes to live, or has been accustomed to, that, to say nothing of the extra expense\\nof children, we cannot afford to marry .” This is a wrong view to take, because  pomp, style\\nand show are not the true objects of marriage ! The married state is a duty and a great\\nprivilege, while its uses are of the highest possible order physically , mentally and spiritually .\\nThe love which brings the two together and which should bind them together , requires only a\\ncomfortable home of respectable appear ance. Young married people should begin like young\\nmarried people; it is more orderly and more conducive to the welfare and true happiness of\\neach that, as time passes on, they build  up their fortunes together , each helping the other—\\nthus af fording new charms that no other course will or can yield.\\nIn the choice of a wife, a man should especially seek congeniality . He shoul d make the\\nacquaintance of a young lady living and moving in the same sphere of life as his own, such as\\nis congenial to his tastes; he should see her in company with other young people and observe\\nhow she treats them ; and particularly notice how she acts towards her father and mother ,\\nbrothers and sisters: for a good daughter and sister always makes a good wife. Study closely\\nher character , her mental discipline, her tastes in reading and her mode of life generally .\\nAbove all, note her disposition as to selfishness, whether she be determined and bent upon\\nhaving her own way in everything, or whether she is yielding and thoughtful of the comfort\\nand happiness of her associates. Remember that in the married state there must be a mutual\\nyielding to each other , though not the sinking of the wife's identity , so that the combined life\\nof the two may become one harmonious whole. Observe what she thinks of children and gether opinio n as to how they should be brought up and educated. Be sure that she is one who\\ncan be loved most tenderly , one for whom a man can make any sacrifice in reason for her\\nsake—for whom one can deny himself any comfort, any and every passion, brave any danger ,\\nand conquer every difficulty in his power , to make her life happy and useful. One quality: Is\\nshe strictly virtuous? Is she chastity itself in thought, word and deed? If you, young man,\\nhave been the same, if you have held yourself in by “bit and bridle,” as it were,—then, if she\\nreciprocates your love, you are at liberty to propose marriage to her .\\nBefore marriage, a young man takes great pains to make himself attractive , is very\\nattentive and polite, keeps up a genteel appearance and is civility itself, that he may woo and\\nwin the young lady most nearly approa ching his ideal of feminine perfection , and the one\\nmost nearly suited to his tastes and congeniality . After marriage he feels that she is his, that\\nshe has pledged herself to this effect; and the law has so decided; she is his, as he is hers,\\nirrevocably . Now , young man, do you mean to be loyal, to be her real husband until death\\ndissolves the allegiance? Then let nothin g cool your ardor . Be as watchful as when you were\\nher wooer and even more so. Let nothing induce you to swerve from your duty, to violate\\nyour vow or to betray your trust. But ever be faithful and true. So may you be accounted\\nworthy of her choice as a husband and worthy to be enrolled among the respected and\\nhonored fathers in our land. Heavier responsibilities rest upon you now than before marriage.\\nYour wife must be protected, supported and cared for in every possible way, and you need to\\nbe even more caref ul to retain her love than you were to win it. You are under heavy\\nresponsibilities to your relatives and the community in which you live, that your united lives\\nbear such fruit as will be to all a deligh t. Together , in your unity , you form as it were a tree;\\nyour united lives throw out branches and leaves, buds and blossoms, and finally fruit in its\\nseason; and every tree is known by its fruit. Bearing in mind the high duties to which as a\\nhusband and a father you are called, seek not to live for carnal pleasures. You have struggled\\nmanfully with yourself and the world and have come up to this stage of your life pure and\\nuncontaminated; and that love which brought you two together , now flows into your united\\nlives from  the Divine Love. Let that love continually operate through you united ly in creating\\nnew human beings who shall ultimately serve to swell the grand army of the Angelic hosts in\\nHeaven.\\nSome well-meaning and otherwise apparently  good husb ands, but not true, form habits of\\nstaying from their homes during their leisure hours, particularly in the evenings. They visit\\nclub house s, billiard  rooms or other places of amusement, leaving their wives at home. Such\\nabsences distress a wife greatly , though her love often restrains any expression of\\ndisapproval. These habits increase, she suffers more and more, loses sleep on his account and\\nher health  fails. The husband's dissipations grow upon him—all such desertions are\\ndissipations when they become habitual—until he loses all relish for the company of his\\nfaithful wife and for the caresses of his young and lovely children, until finally to stay at\\nhome a single evening is a restraint and unhappiness to him. Where now is the plighted faith!\\nWhere now is the tree, its branches and leaves with their buds and blossoms, and what is the\\nfruit? Where now is that pure love whic h he promised when they became united and which\\nshould forever bind them together , and who has almost severed that love? Has not the little\\nthat remains become merely carnal, on his part at least? Where is that union of mind and\\ncommunion of soul that lifts one above sensualism; and without which, sensualism is the\\nonly link and quality left to keep the two together , until death dissolves the union?Y\",\n",
       " \"CHAPTER VII.\\nM\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 [\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00].\\nThe W ife.\\nOUNG  ladies,  why do you marry? Through infancy , childhood and adolescence you\\nhave been  watched over most tenderly  and cared for most lovingly; you have been\\nprotected and educated, and have been  made as happy under the paternal roof as\\ncircumstances would  allow; and this very book has been written largely on your account. It\\nhas been the custom from time immemorial, as it always will be, for girls to complete their\\neducation and then to marry . But alas! how very few seem to realize what married life really\\nis and what will be expected in it; what its duties and responsibilities are, or even what leads\\nto marriage. But to the question why do you even think of getting married? The answer is,\\n“Because it is inhere nt in the mind of every true female character . It was ordain ed of God in\\nher creation, spiritually , mentally , and physically—from her inmost being to her complete\\nultimation. It was in the very design of her creation that she should love and be loved, that\\nshe should be sought after by the male sex, and that she should become a wife and mother .”\\nFirst, let us understand what “marriage”  signifies. The word itself has the same meaning\\nas the Latin word conjugium  and repre sents a conjunction or union together . Carried out to its\\nhigher or more interior meaning, marriage signifies the joining of good and truth—the\\n“good” being represented by the woman  and “truth” being represented by the man. Hence it\\ndenotes the spiritual conjunction of minds, and thence of bodies, in contradist inction to the\\nmerely natural conjunction or joining together of bodies only. So, to secure a real marriage,\\nthere must be a spiritual conjunction of minds; and the conjunction of bodies in wedlock is\\nsimply the ultimation, or manifestation of spiritual principles in marriage.\\nThe true reason why girls marry is because they have an innate principle of love for the\\nmale sex; and this love is drawn from the Lord above. Consequently , it is pure, chaste, and\\nwhen fully  developed, very powerful. In connection with this principle comes the desire to be\\nsought after and loved by a man of congenial character for whose dear sake a woman is\\ninduced to leave father and mother , brothers and sisters, to become the wife of him whom she\\ncan claim as her own dear husband. This Heaven-born principle is what leads and induces the\\nfemale to assent to the marriage relatio n. For her own sake, for his sake as well as for the\\nsake of all parties concerned, this step should be taken very carefully and only after mature\\nconsideration. Once  married, there is no escape from its lifelong duties and responsibilities.\\nShe must yield to him whatever the marriage vow allows, that she may become a wife in the\\nfullest sense of the term. Marriage is a sacred relation, instituted by God Himself, and the\\nsexual approach which follows between husband and wife, is a special avowal of theirrelation to each other; and so often as it is repeated it is a renewal of their obligations to be\\nfaithful to each other . All sexuality is in the order of creation and, coming from the Lord,\\nserves for high and holy purposes. It was never  intended for mere carnal pleasure; as such, it\\nis the profanation and perversion of a great boon to the human race. The man or woman who\\nperverts it must and will, sooner or later , suffer a penalty equal to the transgression.\\nThe husband rightfully expects to find in his wife, as a seal of the marriage covenant, his\\ngreatest possible delight. It should be her greatest delight to give him that pleasure; and if she\\nloves her husband according to her avowal, she will not fail to do this. The feeling, each of\\nthe other's nearness—in thought, word and act, as though each one were intertwined with the\\nother in the most complete union, is a very great delight; even indescribably great. The sexual\\nact itself is really a type of the perfect harmony in which the married pair should dwell\\nthroughout their lives. It teaches a mutual yielding so that the honeymoon, rising so\\nbeautifully and lovingly , may continue to wax lighter and brighter and its fullness be attained\\nin this world only at the dissolution, by a natural death, of a union so orderly and happily\\nformed. It is in the very nature of the male to seek his mate; it is an inborn principle for him\\nto do so, and his health, even his life, certainly his moral life, often depends upon an orderly\\nand lawful indulgence of what this inherent principle demands. The greatest longevity and\\nthe best health are found among fathers and mothers; thereby proving that orderly and well-\\nregulated sexual intercourse is just as necessary to the married couple as are the functional\\ndemands of all other organs of the body . From the foregoing it may be plainly inferred, that,\\nif the wife of a chaste young man who has duly guarded himself from his childhood up, until\\nhe has sought and wedded his mate, fails to reciprocate cheerfully and pleasantly in the seal\\nof connubial affection, she proves a bitter disappointment to him. Not that he is carnal, gross\\nor beastly , no! The principle given him by his Creator and residing in his pure and inmost\\nsoul has been violated by her in whom he placed his life's confidence; she has proved false  to\\nhim in this particular , one upon which their present and eternal welfare so largely depends.\\nYoung ladies about to marry should be taught to understand this matter most fully, in all its\\nbearings. If they pervert marriage in false practices, the love of God, conjugal love, and the\\nlove of infants, the three holiest and noblest inspirations of life, perish togethe r. No woman\\nthen should ever marry without a full knowledge of her duties to her husband, particularly in\\nthe sexual  respect; for without granting this privilege to her husband in full and free accord,\\nthere cannot  be maintained a happy married life.\\nThe duties of marria ge, as a topic, embrace a vast field of thought; and there is so much  to\\nsay thereon, so much advice to tender , so many absolute commands to enjoin, so many\\nwarnings to utter, that it is with difficulty I restrain myself from launching out diffusely in an\\nattempt to give the most important of these. But to so specifically particular ize is not the\\npurpose of this book. Enough is said herein, I trust, to set the reflective mind to thinking\\nseriously on these matters and thereby to awaken the conscience to a full sense of its duties.\\nQuite too many cases have come under my observation where the marriage vow has never\\nbeen consummated or, if consummated at all, in a very begrudging manner , owing to the\\ninsubordination of the wife. Conseque ntly dissatisfaction, unhappiness and frequently a\\npermanent separatio n follows, bringing disgrace upon the family and scandal to their circle of\\nfriends. This is not only wrong, but it is a most unpardonable vice. Sexuality has been\\nordained by God in his wisdom as the means of creation. It exists throughout all nature, in\\nevery tree, plant and shrub, in every animal and insect; in every bird that flies,  in every fish\\nthat swims, in every man and woman. The very best and purest of husbands and wives, all the\\nworld over, indulge in sexuality to their united satisfaction, in full acknowledgment that it is\\nof God and from God. Every wife who is unreasonable or derelict in this duty is untrue to herhusband and commits a sin against the God of Heaven and earth. Since, then, sexuality is so\\nevidently of Divine appointment, it should be committed entirely to him in its ef fects. [I]\\nIf at any time the act prove fruitful and a child be born, it should be considered as a great\\nblessing and gift from God Himself. What is more beautiful than to see a married couple\\nengaged in rearing a new human being destined to become an angel in Heaven! For this\\nindeed is the prime object of sexuality and of the marriage covenant. As has been well said,\\nlife on earth is Heaven's seminary . And yet, so many wives, to their shame be it said, use\\npreventives to conception, thus attemp ting to controvert the order of Nature and Nature's\\nGod; this is one of the greatest crimes of the present age and vengeance will surely be taken\\non every transgressor in this sacred matter . Such practice is secret vice which little by little\\nwears upon the inmost vital principle until the perpetrators of such wrongs suffer untold\\nmisery in their physical nature—often not even suspecting the cause of such suf ferings.\\n“But there is yet another reason, and a very strong moral one, why the wife should not\\nremain childless. There can be no question that the blood of the father mingles with that of\\nthe mothe r through  the medium of the child in utero. (Hence the transmission of blood-\\ndiseases from husba nd to wife.) Hence the indelible impressions made upon a wife by the\\nfather of her offspring—impressions, both mental and physical, which by character or\\nresemblance she often transmits to her children by a second husband. Now , * * * * may not\\nthis account for the similarity of character and identity of tastes, and, indeed, for that\\nwonderful personal resemblance, which sometimes develops between husband and wife? And\\ndoes not this requis ite alone fulfil the Divine interpretation of marriage, that ‘they are no\\nmore twain but one flesh?’” [J]\\nAfter marriage a new order of life is entered upon by the wife, and her family matters\\nshould subordinate all other schemes and projects of her future existence. Her main thought\\nand study should now be, “How can I best fulfil these new duties and responsibilities? First,\\nmy dear husband! how can I be a true help-meet to him? Here we two are to be one, a new\\npunctum saliens , and every act of ours will bear the image of our united lives. No matter\\nwhat may happen, I will be true to my matrimonial vow and to my God; for I am in His\\nhands and my dear husband's.” A married life begun in this way, with such resolutions\\nsincerely and studio usly kept, will secure a life full of happiness and privileges beyond the\\nfondest hope and expectation. When pregnancy occurs, just as soon as the fact be suspected,\\nthe little embryo should be regarded as already a member of the family . Every act of each\\nparent should now be performed in some degree with reference to the forth-c oming infant.\\nThe mother's thoughts particularly should be directed to it as much as possible whilst\\nperforming the uses of life. She should read much that is elevating and ennobling in character\\nas this serves a good purpose in producing a more perfect, more healthy and more brilliant\\nchild. Let her read such books as “Elem ents of Character” by Miss Chandler; “Growth of the\\nMind” by S. Reed; “Sex in Education” by E. H. Clarke, M. D.; also, “Wear and Tear” by\\nS. Weir Mitchell, M. D.; and any other books of like character . Do not forget that the\\neducation of the child begins in uter o.\\nDuring gestation the mother should subsist as far as possible upon fruit, vegetab les and a\\nfarinaceous diet—al ways plain and without spices. Plenty of active exercise is indispensable\\nand the use of a “Health Lift” will be found most beneficial. When the nine months are\\ncompleted, under care of a competent physician, the birth of the child will be accomplished\\nwith but comparativ ely little pain, and its attendant dangers and difficulties will be greatly\\nlessened.T\",\n",

What was done during courtship that made time pass so rapidly and so\\npleasantly? Was every topic so discussed and used up that nothing is now left for an exchange\\nof views? Is carnal pleasure to be the only binding tie? Such a life is not very pure and only a\\npoor use can be made of it. Topics of interest to a married pair should be innumerable and\\ntheir pleasures inexhaustible. Home is the soil in which the tree is to grow; and the richer the\\nsoil, the better for the tree, and the more numerous will be the branches, all of them\\nvigorously developi ng buds and leaves , blossoms and fruit, which will be most fragrant,\\nbeautiful and useful. When amusement outside of home is sought let it be, as far as possible,\\nof a nature that both may enjoy it equally .\\nHusband and Wife! He, being of larger mould in every particular , in head, chest, and all\\nthe vital organs, is the provider , the protector , the guardian of his home; he, the masculine, or\\nrepresentative of the Truth, is to lead the way in conducting home or business affairs. She, the\\nfeminine, or representative of the Good,  inclines to the good way continually; and, as married\\npartners, Good and Truth should be married in them. There cannot be a true evil way nor a\\ngood false way; there can only be a true good way and a good true way. So the wife, the\\ngood, must conjoin herself to her husband, the truth, in order that every truth may result in\\ngood; and the husband, the truth, should  seek to be conjoined to the wife, the good, that every\\ngood may become true. In this there is much wisdom: if the husband be truly  wise he will\\nalways be sure that all his projects are tempered with good; while if the wife be truly good,\\nall her doings will be enlightened by truth. As hand in hand they thus go through life's\\nplanning and doing, the husband will always be assisted by his good, the wife; and the wife\\nwill be led on in good by her truth, the husband. By taking this high and holy ground, there\\nwill be experienced pleasure and happiness by the married couple, far transcending all other\\nmodes of life in existence. Then will each and every organ in the body be seen to have a\\nfitness, a place, and a use which could not possibly be dispensed with, because, each and all\\nthese organs have an originating cause in the mental and spiritual parts of mankind, from\\nwhich they proceed and from which they exist. Thus we see how wrong, how frightfully\\nwrong it is to abuse, or pervert the use of, any of these physical organs which are so sacred\\nand so important to the welfare of the human family . “Dishonor the body , the temple of thesoul, and you dishonor the soul.” “If any man defile the temple of God, him will God\\ndestroy .”—I.

       " \"17.\\nWhen married, the battle for one unite d and harmonious life really begins. The wife's\\ngreat and supreme love for her husband  personally , will allow many privileges which under\\nother circumstances  her timidity and chastity would refuse. Tenderly and with great\\nconsideration should  these privileges be accepted. For, contrary to the opinion of many men,\\nthere is no sexual passion on the part of the bride that induces her to grant such liberties.\\nThen how exquisitely gentle and how forbearing should be the bridegroom's deportment on\\nsuch occas ions! Sometimes such a shock is administered to her sensibilities that she does not\\nrecover from it for years; and in consequence of this shock, rudely or thoughtlessly\\nadministered, she forms a deeply rooted antipathy against the very act which is the bond and\\nseal of a truly happy married life. These sexual unions serve to bring the marri ed pair into a\\nperfectly harmonious relation to each other . And just as tenderly , lovingly and harmoniously\\nshould they join in each and all the daily uses of life which they are called upon to perform.\\nThe sexual relation is among the most important uses of married life; it vivifies the affections\\nfor each other , as nothing else in this world can, and is a powerful reminder of their mutual\\nobligations to one another and to the community in which they live. Indulgen ce, however ,\\nshould not be too frequent, lest it debilitate the pair and undermine their health. The\\nbridegroom and husband should carefully watch over his bride and wife to see that she is not\\na sufferer and should govern himself accordingly . It is better that these renewed obligations\\nshould be made at stated periods, as man is governed so much by habit. As a rule, once or\\ntwice a week, or in some cases once in two weeks, is sufficient; but once a week will suffice\\nin many cases for healthful purposes. During the menstrual flow there should be an entire\\ncessation of the conjugal act. When pregnancy occurs it is in most cases, more healthful and\\nbetter for the expect ant mother to allow  intercourse at regular times, very gently , throughout\\nher gestation.\\nThe object of marri age is the ultimation of that love which brings the two together and\\nbinds them together , in the procreation and rearing of children for Heaven. This is the only\\ntrue aim and sole object about which every earthly desire, interest and plan of the married\\npair should cluster .\\nAs to the question of child-bearing.  No greater crime in the sight of Heaven exists to-day\\nthan that of perverting the natural uses of marriage. This is done in a great variety of ways,\\nevery one of which is criminal, in whate ver form practised; and none will escape the penalty\\n—no, not one. Nature's laws are inexorable; every transgression thereof is surely punished,\\neven at the climacteric period , if not before. The questions of failin g health, of physical\\ninability , or too frequent conceptions are matters for the investigation, advice and decision of\\nan experienced, judicious and upright physician. They should never be taken  in hand and\\njudged upon by the parties themselves. And to the objection “can't afford to have children;\\nthey cost too much, ” I have faith enough to reply , “Our Heavenly Father neve r sends more\\nmouths than he can feed.” Let each one do his and her duty in life and this cavil falls to the\\nground like water—which, when spilled, cannot be gathered up.\\nGood people everywhere rejoice when they behold a married couple living together in an\\norderly manner and rearing a large family of children. How often is Queen Victoria held up\\nas a pattern of excel lence in this respect: she accepted and acknowledged Prince  Albert as her\\nhusband and gave herself to him as his wife; and so indeed she was in every sense of the\\nterm. Although a Queen, sitting on the pinnacle of power , she did not seek to avoid the pangs,\\nthe dange rs or inconveniences of child-bearing. By her own personal strength her twelvechildren were brought forth and her own sensitive fibres and tissues felt the suffering. She\\nnursed, caressed and loved them like a good mother and she was a royal mother ! Other kings\\nand queen s have done  likewise; other husbands and wives, high in power , wealth and fashio n\\nhave done and are still doing the same . And how much the less should we, in the humbler\\nwalks of life, obey the Divine command “Be fruitful and multiply .”\\nIf a husba nd truly loves his wife and if she truly loves him, they will live for each other\\nand in each other , and they will be one; and they will seek to do right in every particular of\\ntheir marital relation. To apply to life the truths advanced above and to realize them, will\\nrequire great effort by the parties in question. This manner of life will not come  of itself; it is\\ntoo good to come without working for. Mutual concessions must be made daily , and several\\ntimes a day; one's own way must frequently be given up, and always when disco vered to be a\\nselfish way, because the mutual good is always to be consulted. Questions of importance\\nshould be discussed  freely and dispas sionately , and a good reason be established before\\nadopting actions that may not lead to proper results. In the marriage co-pa rtnership the\\ninterest in the right and the wrong, the loss and the gain, the lights and the shadows, the\\npleasures and the pains, should be equa lly shared; because they concern one just as much as\\nthe other , and should be equally enjoyed, and equally borne by both.\\nA start is made with loving hearts and this state of affairs must never be allowed to\\ndiminish. The husband should ever be glad to see his wife, and the wife should ever be glad\\nto see her husband. How many husbands never know what reception they will meet with on\\nreturning home after their anxious and exhausting business hours are over for the day; it may\\nbe a happ y or a very unhappy one. How  much it consoles, encourages, lifts up, and rests a\\nman to return to his home after the trying scenes of a day busily spent in providing for the\\nsupport of his family are over, to find his wife affectionate and serene, and all about the\\nhouse brilliant with contentment. Such a wife if she has troubles, and of course she has just as\\nmany troubles as the husband, though of a different kind, and wishes to call the attention of\\nher husban d to them, will do it at a proper time, when she knows it will annoy him the least,\\nand when he will be able to give her the most assistance. She will never try to annoy him; but\\nendeavoring to be a true help-meet will seek in a proper and loving way to get him to be the\\nsame to her. The wife will gain and command the respect of her husband only through kind\\nand loving ways. By her love constantly and judiciously administered she will lead him\\nonward and upward  to higher aspiratio ns and better circumstances in life, throughout their\\ndays of united existence. A scolding, fretting, worrying and selfish wife has ruined for life\\nmany a husband.\\nAll the “self-denial” however , as it is called by some, is not on the wife's side; the\\nhusband too must be forbearing; he must remember on his way home at night that his faithful\\nwife, who has been at home all day, has had trials and disappointments in her domestic\\naffairs; and he must not be disappointed to find domestic arrangements a little disordered, and\\nhis wife somewhat chagrined that, under the circumstances, she really could give him no\\nbetter a reception than he may experience. He must always try to make the best of it and be\\nsatisfied. He must not find fault with the cooking, for instance, but must be perfectly content\\nwith every thing as it is until his well-ma naging wife has had time to overcome her difficulties\\nand troubles.\\nNever find fault with your wife under any circumstances; let your intellect discover a way\\nto better things if need be. A really wise man will never allow a harsh word to escape his lips\\nto a loving wife, or to his harmless children. By so living together a wise husband and aloving wife will soon discover that they two are but complemental to each other—like the\\nWill and Understanding of one individual.L\",\n",
       " \"CHAPTER IX.\\nTO THE UNFORTUNATE.\\nET no one imagine that, because he or she has committed any of the great errors\\nenumerated in former chapters, there is no hopeful future. Such a conclusion need not,\\nnecessarily , be accepted. In very many cases where there is a will to reform, there is\\nalso a way; and very often a complete cure and restoration to health may be effected.\\nDiseased bones may be made sound; ulcerations healed; sore throats cured; blemishes on the\\nskin remo ved; urina ry difficulties may be dissipated or at least greatly amelio rated; sexual\\ndisorders remedied; impaired eyes much improved and defective vision much benefited if not\\nwholly restored; the auditory apparatus helped if not fully cured; and the distracted mind,\\nwith its fanciful imageries, rendered tranquil and rational.\\nTo accomplish all this the mind  must  lead the way. The brain must assert its supremacy ,\\nand the will-power become absolute. It is only where there is a will, an indomitable will, that\\na way out of these direful difficulties is afforded. Let happen what may, no opposing\\ninfluences should dampen the determination to press forward to reformation; and then,\\nsooner or later , the conquest will be made.\\nTo begin with, when the mind is fully determined to overcome all obstacles or perish in\\nthe attempt, consult a judicious physician as advised in the preface of this book. Lose no time\\nwith quackery in any shape or form. Do not be beguiled by those who promise “a speedy\\ncure.” Speedy cures cannot be made in these cases. Strong determination to improve aided by\\nproper medication can, in bad cases, only restore a healthful condition in from two to three\\nyears. The system requires to be made over anew as it were. The current of life must be\\nturned into new channels. New thoughts and new blood must be made to take the place of\\nwhat were wrong and polluted. This will take time and perseverance; and then,  little by little\\nthe old enemies will be overcome and driven out. But progress for the better must be\\nmeasured only from month to month and even then there may be apparent relapses. Let me\\nhowever asseverate, from my abundance of experience in these cases, that there is ultimately ,\\nafter a reasonable time, every hope of becoming sound and healthy again.\\nMany young persons are rendered quite distracted by the sexual instinct being too strong.\\nIt infests them and goads them on to the commission of further unseemly acts—though\\nsuffering much from past transgressions—which it seems almost impossible to avoid. The\\nsensation haunts and clings to them day and night, in spite of every attempt to rise superior\\nthereto. Sometimes nocturnal pollutions, or “wet dreams,” as they are commonly termed,\\nresult from  these or other causes. There must be some cause for this state of things and a rigid\\nexamination into one's mode of life should ascertain the same. It may come from errors indiet, in eating or drinking; in the use of highly seasoned food; or the taking of some\\nmedicinal drug substance. It is well known that many drugs have the power of producing\\nsuch a condition. Should any of the above seem to act as causes, a change shou ld be made at\\nonce. The plainest diet and simplest mode of life is always best in sickness or in health.\\nAgain, one may take too little exercise in the open air. If so, an abundance of physical\\nexertion should be made daily , to insure a natural and healthy condition of all organs of the\\nbody . Or, uncomfortable conditions may arise, as they often do, from some morb id condition\\nof the vital forces. If diet and exercise  are insuf ficient, the judicious physician should be\\nconsulted and every symptom or unnatu ral sensation from the crown of the head to the soles\\nof the feet, should be carefully described to him. In all probability he will remedy the trouble,\\nthus restor ing peace and happiness. The generative organs are as liable to be affected by a\\nmorbid state of the vital forces, as are any other organs of the body; and when so affected\\nthey are just as amenable to treatment.\\nThe above  condition  of affairs is not, however , confined to the male sex. Females often\\nsuffer equally and in the same way. Many young persons, of both sexes, have fallen victims\\nto these disorders who could have been cured by proper medical treatme nt. A female\\nsuffering from the ill effects of any bad habit contracted in youth, or from any sexual or\\nvenereal disorder , should seek medical aid with the same promptness and open ness of heart\\nas a male.  To overcome the vicious habit of self-abuse is no trifling matter; it will require the\\npersistent applicatio n of indomitable will, aided by Christianity—by oft repeated appeals to\\nthe Lord for aid, who lends a willing ear and a helping hand to the poor and needy . When\\nreformation is determined upon, it is better to consult a physician at once and act under his\\nadvice. Besides directing the proper diet and plenty of vigorous exercise in the open air, he\\nwill prescribe the proper medicament.\\nCases of real syphilitic poisoning are most serious affections, and everyone should know\\nof the fearful effects  of this poison—ho w searchingly it infests the whole system, and how it\\ncontaminates the blood and every tissue in the body . Such cases, therefore, should not be\\ntrifled with in any way. Advertised nostrums should be particularly avoided . For, if this\\npoison be simply smothered in one's blood instead of being wholly eradicated and cured, it\\nwill be sure to seize upon the offspring and either destroy them before birth or during\\ndentition. The bare fear of such contam ination should be amply sufficient to deter everyone\\nfrom expo sing him- or herself  to the risk. But, having fallen, by all means seek the aid of a\\njudicious physician.  An experience of nearly forty years in the treatment of these cases, in\\nboth sexes, has given me the power to know whereof I speak; and I do decla re that a very\\nlarge percentage of these cases can be cured in a safe manner; and so perfectly  cured too, that\\nthere will be no danger of transmitting the infection to the offspring. I, by no means stand\\nalone in this statement; many other phys icians, after long years of experience assert the same\\ntruth.\\nTherefore, let no one be discouraged, no matter how far he, or she, has strayed from the\\npaths of virtue or how much suffering has been entailed thereby . In connection with the\\nphysician's help, aid yourself. Have courage! Let the invincible will lead on unflinchingly—\\nupheld by pure thoughts, and good actions will surely follow . “Desire is really dangerous\\nonly when it brings  voluptuous pictures incessantly before the imagination. It thus holds a\\nthousand conflicts with virtue which it conquers in the end; it installs itself in the bosom of\\nthe intellig ence of which it becomes the habitual pre-occupation.” Seek therefore for only\\npure thoughts.We should  at all times exert all the power within us to live correct and blameless lives in\\nevery respect, but particularly so in sexual matters. The happiness, the health, and the lives of\\nfamilies and communities are far more largely dependent upon these matters than is\\ncommonly supposed . Those who have led lives of blameless purity , will continue to do so\\nafter readi ng this book; while those who have gone astray will here find every encouragement\\nto set about their reformation at once. If faithful to the teachings recorded in these pages they\\nwill bless the day and the occasion that inspired the writer to put his hand to this work. The\\nGod of Heaven and Earth knows that the motive that led me to this undertaking was pure, and\\nas solely for the good of humanity , as that purity which prompts a human being to live a\\nblameless life in the sight of his Maker .S\",\n",
       " \"CHAPTER X.\\nORIGIN OF THE SEX.\\nFrom Whence does the Sex Pr oceed and What Determines It?\\nO much has been written about this matter , and so many foolish, low, and really\\ndebasing theories and speculations have been advanced in relation thereto, that I deem\\nit expedient at this time, and in this place, to put forth the true theory of the\\nreproduction of the sexes, one that can endure the test of the most rigid scientific\\ninvestigation. The only theory upon this subject worthy of notice, must be based upon a\\nprinciple that will hold good and true throughout all animated nature, not only in the animal,\\nbut in the vegetable kingdom as well.\\nThe earth is the common mother of the vegetable world; seeds of all kinds fall into her\\nand she brings forth male and female plants according to the seeds plante d. The earth\\ncertainly does not give the sex to plants  for they come forth according to the life inherent in\\nthe seed; if this life-force be male, the plant must be male; and if the life-force of the seed be\\nfemale, the product must be a female plant. The earth can possibly bring forth no other sex\\nthan that which the life-force of the seed impels.\\nThis is true in the animal creation. Within the female grows the seed given her by the\\nmale, be it male or female, and she can grow none other . In other words the male as is very\\nevident on mature reflection gives the soul or the inmost vital principle, and the female\\nclothes that soul, or gives it a body in which to operate. What else can the male do; what\\noffice does he perform, if it is not strictly this: to impart of his life-giving spirit ! The mother\\nin clothing this germ of life commingles, intertwines, and insinuates her own spirit, at the\\nsame time educating, instructing, and determining its development according to the influence\\nshe imparts to it. So the offspring partakes largely of the nature of both its parents. The\\ndetermination as to whether he begets a male or female depends entirely upon the inmost\\nvital state of the male at the time of giving, although he is unconscious of the fact, so that he\\ncan have no choice and no regulation, as some writers most absurdly claim, in the matter of\\nthe forth-c oming sex. He determines or produces it unconsciously and involuntarily , the\\nmother simply receiving, clothing, and issuing from her body what the father has given her .\\nIt must not be forgotten when exploring  these deep subjects that man is a spiritual being,\\nclothed with a material body , that his spirit is his inmost, and that what proceeds from him in\\nthe generative act has life from his inmost; consequently the life-giving principle of his\\nsemen is from his inmost, which constitutes its life-giving power . This inmost from the male,\\nthe begetting power , is clothed by his seminal fluid for an All-wise purpose; it is not the gross\\nmaterial, the clothing, that begets, but the living power which this material contains, whichfructifies, or becomes conjoined, or commingled with the vital force of the ovule of the\\nmother ,[K] so that she can clothe it; and when so conjoined the germ, or seed, is planted  in\\ncongenial soil. Conception has thus really taken place by virtue of this act, and the animal\\nmother proceeds with her reproduction precisely upon the same general principles that\\nmother earth reproduces corn from a single kernel.\\nIt is unive rsally acknowledged that the Lord creates, that we owe all to Him, that He\\ngives us our children, etc., etc. This is true, and it is also true that He makes use of the\\nparents, through whom he operates to this end. By the constant influx of his Divine Love and\\nWisdom He gives us life, and by virtue of this constant influx into the father who begets, the\\nmother's conception becomes doubly sacred. She conceives from her husband, and at the\\nsame insta nt the Lord by virtue of His Divine Power breathes into that conception the breath\\nof life, whereby it becomes a living soul. By the light of this truth we see that it is not the\\nparents who give life to their offspring. They only supply the pure material substances which\\nare organized into the human form by the living and life-giving forces which constantly flow\\nin from the Lord who is life itself and from whom all life constantly emanates.\",\n",

It is therefore necessary, as it is hoped that this essay may be capable of sociological applications, that the writer should define the sense in which he uses the term. By calling it a science is, of course, denoted the view that sociology is a body of knowledge derived from experience of its material and co-ordinated so that it shall be useful in forecasting and, if possible, directing the future behaviour of that material. This material is man in society of associated man.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;\">Sociology, therefore, is obviously but another name for psychology, in the widest sense, for, that is to say, a psychology which can include all the phenomena of the mind without the exception even of the most complex, and is essentially practical in a fuller sense than any orthodox psychology which has yet appeared.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;\">Sociology has, of course, often been described as social psychology and has been regarded as differing from ordinary psychology in being concerned with those forms of mental activity which man displays in his social relations, the assumption being made that society brings to light a special series of mental aptitudes with which ordinary psychology, dealing as it does essentially with the individual, is not mainly concerned. It may be stated at once that it is a principal thesis of this essay that this attitude is a fallacious one, and has been responsible for the comparative sterility of the psychological method in sociology. The two fieldsâ€”the  social  and  the  individualâ€”are  regarded  here  as  absolutely continuous; all human psychology, it is contended, must be the psychology of associated man, since man as a solitary animal is unknown to us, and every</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s11\" style=\"padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">{12}</p><p style=\"padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;\">individual must present the characteristic reactions of the social animal if such exist. The only difference between the two branches of the science lies in the fact that ordinary psychology makes no claim to be practical in the sense of conferring useful foresight; whereas sociology does profess to deal with the complex, unsimplified problems of ordinary life, ordinary life being, by a biological necessity, social life. If, therefore, sociology is to be defined as psychology, it would be better to call it practical or applied psychology than social psychology.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;\">The first effect of the complete acceptance of this point of view is to render very obvious the difficulty and immensity of the task of sociology; indeed, the possibility of such a science is sometimes denied. For example, at an early meeting of the Sociological Society, Professor Karl Pearson expressed the opinion that the birth of the science of sociology must await the obstetrical genius of some one man of the calibre of Darwin or Pasteur. At a later meeting Mr. H. G. Wells went farther, and maintained that as a science sociology not only does not but cannot exist.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;\">Such scepticism appears in general to be based upon the idea that a practical psychology in the sense already defined is impossible. According to some this is because  the  human  will  introduces  into  conduct  an  element  necessarily incommensurable, which will always render the behaviour of man subject to the occurrence  of  true  variety  and  therefore  beyond  the  reach  of  scientific generalization; according to another and a more deterministic school, human conduct, while not theoretically liable to true variety in the philosophic sense or to the intrusion of the will as a first cause, is in fact so complex that no reduction of it to a complete system of generalizations will be possible until science in general has made very great progress beyond its present position. Both views lead in practice to attitudes of equal pessimism towards sociology.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;\">The observable complexity of human conduct is, undoubtedly, very great and</p><p style=\"padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;\">discouraging. The problem of generalizing from it presents, however, one important peculiarity, which is not very evident at first sight. It is that as observers we are constantly pursued by manâ€™s own account of his behaviour; that of a given act our observation is always more or less mixed with a knowledge, derived from our own feelings, of how it seems to the author of the act, and it is much more difficult than is often supposed to disentangle and allow for the influence of this factor. Each of us has the strongest conviction that his conduct and  beliefs  are  fundamentally  individual  and  reasonable  and  in  essence</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s11\" style=\"padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">{13}</p><p style=\"padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;\">independent of external causation, and each is ready to furnish a series of explanations of his conduct consistent with these principles. These explanations, moreover, are the ones which will occur spontaneously to the observer watching the conduct of his fellows.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;\">It is suggested here that the sense of the unimaginable complexity and variability of human affairs is derived less than is generally supposed from direct observation and more from this second factor of introspectual interpretation which may be called a kind of anthropomorphism. A reaction against this in human psychology is no less necessary therefore than was in comparative psychology the similar movements the extremer developments of which are associated with the names of Bethe, Beer, UexkÃ¼ll and Nuel. It is contended that it is this anthropomorphism in the general attitude of psychologists which, by disguising the observable uniformities of human conduct, has rendered so slow the establishment of a really practical psychology. Little as the subject has been studied from the point of view of a thorough-going objectivism, yet even now certain generalizations summarising some of the ranges of human belief and conduct might already be formulated. Such an inquiry, however, is not the purpose of this essay, and these considerations have been advanced, in the first place, to suggest that theory indicates that the problem of sociology is not so hopelessly difficult as it at first appears, and secondly, as a justification for an examination of certain aspects of human conduct by the deductive method. The writer would contend that while that method is admittedly dangerous when used as a substitute for a kind of investigation in which deductive processes are reduced to a minimum, yet it has its special field of usefulness in cases where the significance of previously accumulated facts has been misinterpreted, or where the exacter methods have proved unavailing through the investigator having been without indications of precisely what facts were likely to be the most fruitful subject for measurement. This essay, then, will be an attempt to obtain by a deductive consideration of conduct some guidance for the application of those methods of measurement and co-ordination of facts upon which all true science is based.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;\">A very little consideration of the problem of conduct makes it plain that it is in</p><p style=\"padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;\">the region of feeling, using the term in its broadest sense, that the key is to be sought. Feeling has relations to instinct as obvious and fundamental as are the analogies  between  intellectual  processes  and  reflex  action;  it  is  with  the consideration of instinct, therefore, that this paper must now be occupied.</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s11\" style=\"padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">{14}</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s11\" style=\"padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">{15}</p></li>\n"
